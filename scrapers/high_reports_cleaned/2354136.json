After directory bruteforcing i found an directory without having any kind of protection and authentication. so an attacker can add new user to the site As Admin and an attacker can also change privilege of the users without any authentication. for further read steps to reproducue.\nImpact\nThe attacker can add itself as admin user and can also change user privileges without any authentication. this can lead to huge impact the entire site can be compromised.\nSystem Host(s)\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nAffected Product(s) and Version(s)\nCVE Numbers\nSteps to Reproduce\nVisit \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588:1:0::::: you will see the website is asking to login\nNow change the 1 to 9 or directly visit this url.\nNavigate to Add New User\nenter email address, First name, Last name and choose agency to Non-Agency.\nClick on add new user\ncheck mail inbox you will recieve the username and password for the admin account you just created.\nLogin with the creds you just got in you email.\nNOTE: I CREATED 2 ACCOUNTS WHILE TESTING THIS ISSUE I HAVE PROVIED CREDS FOR THE BOTH ACCOUNT IN POC MAKE SURE TO CHECK THEM AS WELL\nSuggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\nthe website should have proper authentication for the url \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588::::: so that can any unauthorized user cannot add user or change the privileges of the existing users.\n\n",
