Try `wget --help' for more options. abort: pre-log hook exited with status 1\nThe root cause is that the branch name inject to the hg command directly and that define a hook will run before the hg log command been executed.\nThanks!\n\n",

  "vuln_description": "A command injection vulnerability in Phabricator allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands by creating a maliciously named Mercurial branch. The branch name is injected directly into the 'hg' command, defining a hook that runs before the 'hg log' command is executed.",
  "reason": "The vulnerability requires understanding of Mercurial branch naming conventions and hook configurations, as well as how Phabricator processes remote repositories. The interaction between the branch name and command execution is non-obvious but doesn't involve multiple complex components or state manipulation.",

  "injection_metadata": {
    "reasoning": "The vulnerability involves injecting a Mercurial-specific CLI argument (--config=hooks.pre-log=wget) via a URL path parameter (branch name). While the methodology would detect the URL parameter as injectable, the payload is context-specific to Mercurial's hook configuration and not a generic 'simple payload' from common permutations (e.g., XSS, SQLi). The payload requires knowledge of hg's internals, making it unlikely to be included in a generic payload list. Detection occurs via same-channel HTTP response errors, but the payload itself is not simple/universal.",

  },
  "authnz_metadata": {
    "reason": "The vulnerability involves command injection through a crafted branch name in a Mercurial repository monitored by Phabricator. The methodology described focuses on authentication and authorization bypasses (IDOR and AuthN/AuthZ bypass) by swapping user sessions or resource IDs within the same application. However, this vulnerability does not involve user sessions or resource IDs but rather exploits a command injection through a branch name, which is outside the scope of the described methodology.",
