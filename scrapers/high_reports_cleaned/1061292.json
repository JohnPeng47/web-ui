  "content": "\nSummary:\nTAMS administrators are supposed to approve or deny all registration requests. The dashboard that shows these administrators details of a registration request calls the endpoint https://tamsapi.gsa.gov/user/tams/api/usermgmnt/pendingUserDetails/(REGISTRATION_ID), where (REGISTRATION_ID) is numeric.\nThis endpoint will, without authentication, return the email, address, phone, attachment IDs, address, corporate info, and user roles. It will also return their request status and denial reason if applicable.\nAttachments can then be viewed unauthenticated through https://tamsapi.gsa.gov/user/tams/api/usermgmnt/getAttachmentBytes/(ATTACHMENT_ID).\nSteps To Reproduce:\nNavigate to the following URL: https://tamsapi.gsa.gov/user/tams/api/usermgmnt/pendingUserDetails/2634\nFor attachments, navigate to the following URL: https://tamsapi.gsa.gov/user/tams/api/usermgmnt/getAttachmentBytes/600\nRecommended Mitigation:\nOnly allow users with valid JWT tokens for the admin role view these two endpoints.\nImpact\nAn unauthorized attacker can view personal information about contractors and employees gaining access to TAMS.\n\n",

Additionally, attachments can be viewed unauthenticated by directly accessing their URLs.",

The methodology explicitly checks for unauthenticated access to actions (step d) and substitution of resource IDs (step e), which aligns with the attack vector. Since the vulnerability exists within the same application's authorization boundaries and requires no cross-application context, it fits the described IDOR/AuthZ detection patterns.",
