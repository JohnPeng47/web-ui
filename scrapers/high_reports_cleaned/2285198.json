    "content": "\nSummary:\nI figured I'm well overdue for this.\nLooking forward to the 2024 LHE season!\nI <3 you Hackerone, & Community Team!\nDescription:\nCode 7.42 KiB\n1\n2Every hacker on Hackerone liked Live Hacking a lot\u2026  \n3But ArchAngel who\u2019d been to fifteen did NOT!  \n4The Angel hated hacking! The whole live event season!  \n5Now, please don\u2019t ask why. No one quite knows the reason.\n6\n7It could be perhaps there\u2019s a WAF he can\u2019t thwart,  \n8It could be perhaps the dupe window was too short,  \n9But I think that the most likely reason of all,  \n10May have been that the snack options were two sizes too small.\n11\n12Whatever the reason, dupe window or the snackers,  \n13He dreaded an invite while HATING the hackers,  \n14Staring at his monitor with a sour, bearded frown,  \n15At all the hackers having fun in the live-event town.\n16\n17For he knew every hacker at the LHE venue,  \n18Was busy ordering drinks from the happy hour menu,  \n19\u201cAnd they\u2019re collabing on bugs!\u201d He snarled with a sneer,  \n20\u201cTomorrow is the event day, it\u2019s practically here!\u201d\n21\n22Then he growled, with his angelic fingers nervously drumming,  \n23\u201cI MUST find some way to stop bounties from coming!\u201d  \n24For Tomorrow, he knew, all the Customer girls and boys,  \n25Would wake bright and early. They'd ready their employees!\n26\n27And then! Oh, the exploits! Oh, the exploits!  \n28Exploits! Exploits! Exploits!  \n29That's one thing he hated! The EXPLOITS!  \n30EXPLOITS! EXPLOITS! EXPLOITS!\n31\n32Then the hackers young and old would sit and hunt bugs.  \n33They\u2019d find bugs, and find bugs, and find BUGS BUGS BUGS BUGS!  \n34They\u2019d find bugs for the customer, who\u2019d give them some hugs,  \n35Which is something that made the arch angel say \u201cugh!\u201d\n36\n37And THEN they\u2019d do something he liked least of all!  \n38Every hacker at the live event, the tall and the small,  \n39Would slam on the keyboard with their fingers jabbing,  \n40They\u2019d hack side by side, and the hackers would start collabing!\n41\n42They\u2019d collab! And they\u2019d collar! And they\u2019d COLLAB COLLAB COLLAB!  \n43And the more the Arch Angel thought of this Live Event Collab,  \n44The more the Arch Angel thought, \u201ctheir bugs I must grab!\u201d  \n45Why, for thirty-four years I\u2019ve put up with it now!\n46\n47\u201cI MUST stop the Live Event from starting! But HOW?\u201d  \n48Then he got an idea! An awful idea!  \n49The Arch Angel got a wonderful AWFUL idea!  \n50\u201cI know just what to do!\u201d The Angel said with fervent,\n51\n52As he put on his best Argentine accent  \n53And he chuckled, \u201cThis is the ruse of the century!\u201d  \n54\u201cWhy with an accent and some stilts, I\u2019ll look just like Ari!\u201d  \n55\u201cAll I need is some hair\u2026\u201d The Angel looked around.\n56\n57But since The Angel was bald, there was none to be found.  \n58Did that stop the Arch Angel? No! The Angel simply said,  \n59\u201cIf I can\u2019t grow my own hair, I\u2019ll steal some good hair instead!\u201d  \n60So he called up Nicole, and took out his shears,\n61\n62And glued on her locks, right above his ears.  \n63Then he loaded some bags and some old empty sacks,  \n64Onto a plane to go steal some uber leet hax.  \n65The Arch Angel was giddy, as his plane landed down,\n66\n67And slunk from the airport in the live event town.  \n68The venue was dark. He\u2019d have so much success!  \n69All the hackers were still barhopping and partying with Jess!  \n70When he came to first room of swag he\u2019d finesse.\n71\n72\u201cThis is stop number one,\u201d the old Ari-fake hissed,  \n73And he walked in the door, empty bags in his fist.  \n74He tried to log into Twitch, a task very painful,  \n75But if Ariel could do it, then so could the Angel.\n76\n77He got stuck only once, for a moment or two.  \n78Then he restarted his laptop, his monitor blue.  \n79And announced to the Twitch audience who was there for a show,  \n80\u201cThese swag boxes,\u201d he grinned, \u201care the first things to go!\u201d\n81\n82Then he slithered and slunk, with a smile most unpleasant,  \n83Around the whole room, and took every swag present!  \n84T-shirts! Waterbottles! Stickers! Hoodies!  \n85Custom Snowboards, and other long-awaited goodies!\n86\n87And he stuffed them in bags. Then the Arch Angel of gloom,  \n88Set his eyes next on the triaging room.  \n89He slunk into that room. He watched the scope call!  \n90He peaked at the triage queue. His jaw started to fall!\n91\n92He darted out of that room as quick as a flash.  \n93Why, the Angel was disgusted they\u2019d make so much cash!  \n94So he set to \u201cNA\u201d all the bugs that were Lows.  \n95\u201cAnd NOW!\u201d Grinned the Angel, \u201cI\u2019ll mark the Crits as Infos!\u201d\n96\n97And the Angel was closing reports without love  \n98When he heard a small sound, like the coo of a dove.  \n99He turned around fast, and looking quite irate,  \n100Was ol Caitlin Allison, whom they call Cait the Great.\n101\n102The Angel had been caught by this astute Hackeronie,  \n103Who he hoped wouldn\u2019t see that he was just an Ari phony.  \n104She stared at the Angel and said, \u201cAriel, why,\u201d  \n105\u201cWhy are you closing the bugs out? WHY?\u201d\n106\n107But you know that old Angel was so smart and so slick,  \n108He thought up a lie, and he thought it up quick!  \n109\u201cWhy my sweet little Cait,\u201d the fake Ariel lied,  \n110\u201cThere\u2019s a leaderboard change that Shlomie just tried.\u201d\n111\n112\u201cSo I\u2019m closing out TEST bugs, so don\u2019t look so deflated\u201d  \n113\u201cI\u2019m just making sure that reputation gets updated.\u201d  \n114And his fib fooled the Cait. Then he patted her head,  \n115And he bought her a cosmo and he sent her to bed.\n116\n117And when Cait the Great went to sleep with her booze,  \n118He started closing again, he had no time to lose!  \n119The last bug he closed, was a doozy from Chap,  \n120Then he opened up the leaderboard for the event, the old sap.\n121And with one press of a button, he shut down the whole app.  \n122\n123And the one little bug that he left still open,  \n124Was a CSRF from Justin that no one had hope in.  \n125Then he did the same thing to other program\u2019s queues,\n126Knowing that without bugs, the all the hackers would lose!  \n127\n128It was quarter past dawn\u2026 All the hackers still hung-over,  \n129All the Hacker\u2019s still asnooze, when his laptop he hunched over,  \n130He packed it up with their swag! Their free drinks! Their Macs!\n131Their Lenovos! Their chargers! Their stickers! Their snacks!  \n132\n133Three thousand feet up! Up the side of Mt Hood,  \n134He planned to dump it off the mountain for good!  \n135\u201cPoohPooh to the Hackers!\u201d He was fiendishly humming!\n136\u201cThey\u2019re finding out now that no live event is coming!\u201d  \n137\n138\u201cThey\u2019re just waking up! I know just what they\u2019ll do!\u201d  \n139\u201cTheir mouths will hang open a minute or two,\"\n140\"Then the Hackers at the Live Event will all cry BooHoo!\u201d\n141\n142\u201cThat\u2019s a noise,\u201d grinned the Angel, \u201cThat I simply MUST hear!\u201d  \n143So he paused. And the Angel put a hand to his ear.  \n144And he did hear a sound coming in through the Slack.  \n145Was it the sound of hackers when they aren\u2019t able to hack?!\n146\n147But the sound wasn\u2019t sad! Why, this sound sounded merry!  \n148It couldn\u2019t be so! But it WAS merry! VERY!  \n149He stared at the Live Event! The Angel popped his eyes!  \n150Then he shook! What he saw was a shocking surprise!\n151\n152Every hacker at the Live Event, the tall and the small,  \n153Was collaborating! Without any bounties at all!  \n154He HADN\u2019T stopped the Live Event from coming! IT CAME!  \n155Somehow or other, it came just the same!\n156\n157And the Angel, with his angelic fingers tapping on his keyboard,  \n158Stood puzzling and puzzling: \u201cWhy are Live Events so adored?!\u201d  \n159\u201cIt came without bounties! It came without hacks!\u201d  \n160\u201cIt came without waterbottles, shirts, or backpacks!\u201d\n161\n162And he puzzled three hours, till his puzzler was sore.  \n163Then the Angel thought of something he hadn\u2019t before!  \n164\u201cMaybe Live Events,\u201d he thought, \u201caren\u2019t just about loot.\u201d  \n165\u201cMaybe Live Events,\u201d he thought \u201care about friends and customers to boot!\u201d\n166\n167And what happened next? Well\u2026at Hackerone they say,  \n168That the Angel\u2019s friend circle grew three sizes that day!  \n169And the minute his heart didn\u2019t feel quite so tight,  \n170He whizzed with his load through the bright morning light,\n171\n172And re-opened the bugs, and gave out swag that was swell,  \n173And he, HE HIMSELF, The Angel gave the first Show & Tell.\n174\nImpact\nMerry Christmas & Happy New Year!\n\n",

    "vuln_description": "The vulnerability involves the Arch Angel exploiting the trust and impersonation of an event organizer (Ariel) to disrupt the live hacking event. By gaining unauthorized access, he manipulates the event's bug triage process, steals swag, and attempts to sabotage the event's success. The attack leverages social engineering, unauthorized access, and manipulation of event systems.",
    "reason": "This vulnerability involves multiple complex components: social engineering to impersonate a trusted figure, unauthorized access to event systems, manipulation of bug reports, and disruption of the event infrastructure. The attack requires understanding the event's workflow, the trust dynamics among participants, and the technical systems involved. The non-obvious interaction between social engineering and system manipulation adds to the complexity.",
