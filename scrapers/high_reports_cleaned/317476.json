When the victim authorizes the login, their OAuth token is sent to the attacker's domain instead of Periscope's, enabling the attacker to gain control of the victim's account.",

This matches the methodology's criteria because:\n1. The Host header parameter was detected during regular traffic logging (steps 1-3)\n2. A simple payload (domain prefix injection) was used without custom filter bypasses\n3. The payload's success was immediately observable in the HTTP response's redirect URL (same-channel detection)\n4. Host header manipulation is a common test vector in basic parameter injection testing",
