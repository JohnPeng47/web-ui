    "reasoning": "The reported issue involves an S3 bucket misconfigured to allow write/delete access to any AWS user (via AWS CLI), which is an AuthZ misconfiguration. The methodology focuses on detecting AuthZ bypass via session/resource substitution in HTTP requests. However, this S3 vulnerability stems from AWS S3 bucket policy/ACL misconfiguration, not application-level session/resource manipulation. The detection here would require direct S3 permission testing (e.g., AWS CLI commands like `s3 mv`), not HTTP request substitution, making it outside the scope of the described methodologies.",
