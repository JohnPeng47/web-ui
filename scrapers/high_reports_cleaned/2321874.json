    "content": "\nSummary:\nI hope you're doing well. I stumbled upon one of your assets. Upon further inspection I realized that the asset was running an outdated version of Swagger.\nThe outdated version of Swagger is well-known for Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities so I went ahead and attempted to test it in https://notification-server-v2.sz-my.mtn.com/. Turns out, it's vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting. To reproduce it, please follow the steps of reproduction. I have not assessed the full impact of this vulnerability but it is highly probable that a malicious actor could exploit to takeover accounts of applications hosted under *.mtn.com. I hope this gets patched soon. If there's some additional information that you need from my side, please let me know. Thank you.\nSteps To Reproduce:\n[add details for how we can reproduce the issue]\nGo to the following URL https://notification-server-v2.sz-my.mtn.com/index.html?configUrl=https://jumpy-floor.surge.sh/test.json\nObserve the alert pop up like in the screenshot below\n<image_0>\nSupporting Material/References:\n[list any additional material (e.g. screenshots, logs, etc.)]\n[attachment / reference]\nImpact\nA malicious actor could execute arbitrary scripts\n\n",
