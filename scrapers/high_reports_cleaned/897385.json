    "reasoning": "The 2FA bypass vulnerability involves sending a blank code parameter during authentication. The described methodology focuses on testing authorization boundaries by swapping user sessions, actions, and resource IDs. However, this vulnerability stems from a missing null/empty value check in the server's code validation logic rather than improper session/resource authorization. The methodology does not explicitly include testing for missing parameters or empty values in critical fields like 2FA codes, which is a distinct class of input validation flaw.",
