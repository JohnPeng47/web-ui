  "vuln_description": "The Custom Emoji Page has a Reflected XSS vulnerability in the building flash message. The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code via the 'name' parameter in the URL, which is then executed in the context of the user's browser.",

    "reasoning": "The reflected XSS vulnerability occurs in the 'name' parameter of a GET request, which would be logged during regular navigation (steps 1-3 of the methodology). The payload uses a basic unencoded script tag without filter bypass techniques, matching the 'simple payload' definition. Since the injection is reflected in the immediate HTTP response (flash message) within the same endpoint, detection falls under 'same channel' execution validation without requiring complex navigation (step 3 of Simple Payloads).",

The proposed methodologies focus on detecting AuthN/AuthZ bypasses or IDOR vulnerabilities by manipulating user sessions, actions, and resource IDs, which are not applicable to XSS vulnerabilities.",
