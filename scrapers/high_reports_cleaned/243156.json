By assigning a maliciously crafted string like ../../../../../any/where to the field, an attacker can create an arbitrary file out of the directory of the gem, or even replace an existing file with a malicious file.\nProof of Concept 1: Create a file anywhere\nThis PoC attempts to create a file /tmp/malicious-0/BOOOOM.\n1) Download the attached file malicious.gem.\n2) Run gem install malicious.gem --no-doc.\n3) /tmp/malicious-0/BOOOOM should be created.\nmalicious.gem assigns ../../../../../../../../../../tmp/malicious as name field. This attack is relatively weak since the path must include a directory named <name>-<version>, such as malicious-0. Still, there are many chances that cause a catastrophe. For example, think of replacing a file in /etc/dbus-1/.\nProof of Concept 2: Replace rackup command\nThis PoC attempts to replace gems/rack-2.0.3/bin/rackup with a malicious file.\n1) Download the attached file replace-rackup.gem.\n2) Run gem install rack -v 2.0.3.\n3) Run gem install replace-rackup.gem --no-doc.\n4) Run rackup. It will emit just BOOOOM!.\nreplace-rackup.gem assigns ../gems/rack as name field, and contains a malicious file bin/rackup. This is really exploitable for attackers.\nNote\nFor how to create the malicious gems, see the attached file src.tar.gz.\nIn my opinion, this attack is much more dangerous than the issues I reported recently. I hope you could fix this issue ASAP.\n\n",

    "vuln_description": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to create or overwrite arbitrary files on the system by exploiting the lack of validation in the name field of a gem's metadata.gz. By crafting a malicious gem with a specially constructed name field (e.g., ../../../../../any/where), the attacker can manipulate file paths during installation, leading to unauthorized file creation or overwriting.",
    "reason": "The attack involves understanding the gem package structure and metadata manipulation, but the core vulnerability is straightforward once the gem packaging process is understood. The attack does not require complex interactions or state manipulations, and the logic of path traversal is a well-known vulnerability pattern.",
