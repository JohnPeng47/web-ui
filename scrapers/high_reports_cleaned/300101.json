    "title": "lite:sess Query Parameter Can Generate SSL-protected Reflected XSS in https://m.uber.com/0-dfffb25d2cf6ceeb0a27.js Endpoint",
    "content": "\nSummary\nThe lite:sess request parameter at the https://m.uber.com/0-dfffb25d2cf6ceeb0a27.js mobile endpoint is copied into a javascript string encapsulated in double quotation marks, resulting in SSL-protected payloads being reflected unmodified in the application's response. The script-src whitelist at the endpoint includes a wildcard *.cloudfront.net host, which could be used by any attacker with an Amazon Web Services account to provision an arbitrary cloudfront.net host to serve trusted files from. The endpoint also has a missing base-uri, which allows the injection of base tags. They can be used to set the base URL for all relative (script) URLs to an attacker controlled domain. In addition to the reflected XSS issue, both the script-src and basi-uri issues are considered high severity findings under Content Security Policy 3.\nSecurity Impact\nUsing the lite:sess query variable, arbitrary SSL-protected XSS can be reflected unescaped from the https://m.uber.com/0-dfffb25d2cf6ceeb0a27.js mobile endpoint, resulting in the ability for an attacker to generate arbitrary javascript and/or html content.\nReproduction Steps\nhttps://m.uber.com/0-dfffb25d2cf6ceeb0a27.js?lite:sess=%22%7D}</script><div%20class%3D%27_b%20_c%20_d%20_e%20_f%20_g%20_h%20_i%20_a3%20_a4%20_a5%20_a6%20_a7%20_a8%20_a9%20_aa%20_ab%20_ac%20_ad%20_ae%20_af%20_ag%20_ah%20_ai%20_aj%20_ak%20_al%20_am%20_an%20_ao%20_ap%20_aq%20_ar%20_as%20_at%20_au%20_av%20_aw%27><a%20href%3D\"http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lyft.com\">Some%20arbitrary%20link%20text<%2Fa><%2Fdiv>%0A\nImpact\nWith a properly crafted javascript and/or html page, an attacker could harvest Uber login and password credentials, credit card payment information etc.\n\n",

    "vuln_description": "The vulnerability is a reflected XSS in Uber's mobile endpoint where the 'lite:sess' parameter is inserted into a JavaScript string without proper escaping. Additionally, the CSP policy has weaknesses (wildcard *.cloudfront.net in script-src and missing base-uri) that can be exploited to bypass protections.",
    "reason": "The vulnerability requires understanding multiple components: 1) identifying the unescaped parameter reflection, 2) recognizing the CSP bypass opportunities through cloudfront.net and base tag injection, and 3) crafting a payload that works within Uber's specific JavaScript context. While XSS is common, the specific CSP bypass techniques and Uber's implementation context add complexity.",

The methodologies described focus on detecting IDOR and AuthN/AuthZ bypass vulnerabilities by testing different combinations of user sessions, actions, and resource IDs within the same application. Since the reported issue is about XSS and not about crossing authorization boundaries or accessing unauthorized resources, it does not fall under the scope of the described methodologies.",
