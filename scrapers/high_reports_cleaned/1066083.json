    "content": "\nSummary:\nThe form within the \"My Account\" page in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588mil fails to verify the CSRF token used when an user makes changes such as changing the password and other details. For example, an attacker can change the user's email address, full name, phone number, etc. In this way the attacker can gain full control over the user's account.\nNote\nIn order to get a valid CSRF token you will need to create an account and make any change in \"My account\" after this you can grab the value of the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 token and use it in your CSRF attack.\nDescription:\nCross-site request forgery (also known as CSRF) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce users to perform actions that they do not intend to perform. It allows an attacker to partly circumvent the same origin policy, which is designed to prevent different websites from interfering with each other.\n## Impact\nAttackers can take over accounts.\n## Step-by-step Reproduction Instructions\nHost the attached proof of concept in your server and change the desired values.\nWhile authenticated visit the attacker's website that hosts the CSRF poc\nOn a different browser or incognito session log in with the new email address and password\nImpact\nAttackers can take control over any user account.\n\n",
