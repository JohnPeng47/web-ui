This could be exploited to host malware or perform social engineering attacks.",
    "reason": "The vulnerability involves a straightforward bypass of authentication by appending a specific parameter (?mode=public) to the URL. The attack does not require multiple components, complex interactions, or manipulation of application states. The ability to upload arbitrary files, including executables, is a common and well-documented vulnerability.",
