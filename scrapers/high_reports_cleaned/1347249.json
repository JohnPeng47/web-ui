    "content": "\nVulnerability tested on:- Brave 1.29.81 Chromium: 93.0.4577.82 (Official Build) (64-bit)\nVulnerability description:- For security measures and for privacy purposes, Brave has the ability to open a normal tab of the Brave when we navigate to: chrome://wallet, chrome://history etc. due to the reason that Tor should be blocking privileged URIs like file:///, chrome:// etc. When we open local storage URIs or the Data URIs, it is blocking. So, we can say that TOR in Brave protects users from opening anything privileged in the browser.\nBut there is some weird case for: chrome://downloads and brave://inspect/#devices. Both can be dangerous when there is a UXSS present there because it can get to know about the data. The brave://device-log/ looks interesting too, why do we see the device log of brave in the TOR Network in the Brave?\nSteps to reproduce:\nOpen Brave with TOR\nNavigate to brave://inspect/#devices\nExpected behavior?\n--> When we are doing device debugging, it should have opened normal Brave and shouldn't open the privileged URI in the TOR session itself. Open chrome://bookmarks and chrome://history\nActual behavior?\n--> It opens the debugging session inside the protected tor session.\nSuggestions?\n--> We should block chrome://downloads, brave://inspect/#devices, brave://device-log/ etc. and when somebody tries to navigate to those URIs, a normal Brave session should be started like we do for chrome://history as it keeps TOR away from personal information inside the brave URIs.\nImpact\nInformation disclosure.\n\n",

    "vuln_description": "Brave's TOR mode allows privileged URIs like brave://inspect/#devices and brave://device-log/ to be accessed within the TOR session, potentially exposing sensitive information if combined with a UXSS vulnerability. This contradicts the expected behavior where such privileged URIs should open in a normal Brave session.",
    "reason": "The vulnerability involves understanding Brave's TOR mode behavior and identifying inconsistencies in how privileged URIs are handled. The discovery requires testing various chrome:// and brave:// URIs to find which ones bypass TOR protections, but the steps themselves are straightforward.",
