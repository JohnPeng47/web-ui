  "content": "\nSummary:\nThe subdomain \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 had an CNAME record pointing to an unclaimed \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 webservice. This is a high severity security issue because an attacker can register the subdomain on \u2588\u2588\u2588 and therefore can own the subdomain \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\nDescription:\nThe dangling CNAME record of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is pointing to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 which was not claimed by you. I registered a service with this name and therefore was able to takeover the subdomain. Every attacker doing this has afterwards full control over the contents served on this subdomain.\nSubdomain Affected:\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nProof Of Concept:\nI have uploaded a simple subdomain takeover PoC on http://\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nStep-by-step Reproduction Instructions\nOpen \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and register for web app which is under market place. I have used \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (See: \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588)\nAfter registering, go to Custom Domains which will be available under settings. (See: \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588)\nIn here, add custom domain i have used \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (See: \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588)\nAfter that upload any PoC you want to upload. I have used \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 which has my PoC. (See: \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588)\nSuggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\nRemove the dangling CNAME record for \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nClaim it back in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 portal after I release it\nReference\nSome hackerone reports #661751 #325336\nNOTE:\nI have claimed the subdomain http://\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 at the current moment to keep it safe from malicious users. Whenever you want i will release \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.\u2588\u2588\u2588. Afterwards you can claim it back.\nImpact\nSubdomain takeover is abused for several purposes:\nMalware distribution\nPhishing / Spear phishing\nXSS\n\n",

  "vuln_description": "A subdomain takeover occurs when a subdomain's CNAME record points to an external service (e.g., a cloud provider) that is no longer claimed or configured. An attacker can register the unclaimed service, effectively gaining control over the subdomain and serving malicious content.",

Since this vulnerability is about DNS misconfiguration and external service registration, it falls outside the scope of the described methodologies.",
