This is not directly related to authentication or authorization bypass within a single application's user sessions or resource IDs, but rather a browser-specific SOP bypass. The proposed methodologies focus on testing within the same application's context (user sessions, actions, resource IDs) and do not cover browser-level SOP bypasses.",
