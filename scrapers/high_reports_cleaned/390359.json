  "vuln_description": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to parse WSDL resources via the SOAP Admin Panel, extract functions, and manipulate SQL queries to execute arbitrary SQL commands. This can lead to remote code execution and compromise of the entire DoD Information System.",
  "reason": "The attack involves understanding and manipulating SOAP WSDL parsing and SQL query execution, which requires knowledge of both SOAP and SQL injection techniques. However, once the initial access to the SOAP Admin Panel is achieved, the steps to exploit the vulnerability are relatively straightforward.",

  "authnz_metadata": {
    "reason": "The vulnerability involves SQL injection through SOAP WSDL parsing, which is a server-side issue unrelated to authentication or authorization boundaries being crossed by swapping user sessions or resource IDs. The methodology described focuses on AuthN/AuthZ and IDOR vulnerabilities by manipulating user sessions and resource access patterns, not on server-side injection vulnerabilities.",
    "is_detectable": false
  },
  "injection_metadata": {
    "reasoning": "The vulnerability involves SQL injection via tampered SOAP/WSDL requests. The methodology would detect it if: (1) WSDL parsing occurs during regular navigation (e.g., SOAP Admin Panel access), (2) SQL parameters are identified as injectable during analysis, and (3) simple SQLi payloads (e.g., `UNION SELECT`) trigger database leaks in the same response channel. The report implies no advanced filter bypass was needed, and database names were directly extractable via HTTP responses, aligning with the methodology's 'simple payload' criteria.",
