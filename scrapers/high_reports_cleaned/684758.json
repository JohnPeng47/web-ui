  "content": "\nDescription\nHello. I was able to identify another one Cisco TelePresence SX80 device located on the https://\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 right near the previous device \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 (after #684070 report I decided to check \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588* range)\nAccording to the IP Info: https://ipinfo.io/AS257/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u25880/24 it belongs to ASN with ID\nCode 9 Bytes\n1AS257 \u2588\u2588\u2588\nThe mentioned instance has same credentials admin:admin.\nThis instance is different and less used, the logs reveals that last time device was used in 2017 year.\nPOC\nhttps://\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nLogin with admin:admin\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nSince we are logged in as admin, we can completely control the device and all connections, and add our startup scripts via https://\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588/web/scripts thus achiecing code execution.\nSuggested fix\nChange the credentials and likely you will need to reset the device to factory settings\nImpact\nPotential device compromise and code execution. This devices are used mainly for trainings, briefings, and demonstration rooms, as well as auditoriums, so attacker with full control of the device potentially can intercept the data (RCE potential is interesting, but ability to silently compromise the device and use it as backdoor can be much more harmful).\n\n",
