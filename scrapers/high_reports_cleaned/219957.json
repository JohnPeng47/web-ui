Remember, the more detail you provide, the easier it is for us to verify and then potentially issue a bounty, so be sure to take your time filling out the report!\nSummary: An attacker can craft a custom message using the REST API that, once seen by the observer, executes arbitrary code in the context of the client user.\nDescription: According to the API documentation chat messages can have attachments. These attachments then can have fields which contain a title and subtitle for the attachment. When the attachment has an image_url assigned, the first field's value can be used to inject HTML tags. For example <img onload=\"\"> can be used to execute arbitrary code. < must be the leading character of the field's value property.\nReleases Affected:\nClient App (OSX)\nFirefox 48 (Debian)\nFirefox 52 (OSX)\nChrome 58 (OSX)\nSteps To Reproduce (from initial installation to vulnerability):\nCreate a Channel or get obtain a RoomId of a private conversation\nLogin to the Rest API\nSend crafted message\nSupporting Material/References:\nCode 466 Bytes\n1# Login to get Auth Token and User Id\n2curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/v1/login -d \"username=<USER_NAME>&password=<PASSWORD>\"\n3\n4# Send crafted message\n5curl -H \"X-Auth-Token: <USER_TOKEN>\" -H \"X-User-Id: <USER_ID>\" http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/v1/chat.postMessage -d \"channel=<CHANNEL_NAME>&attachments[0][image_url]=/assets/logo&attachments[0][fields][0][title]=&attachments[0][fields][0][value]=<img src=/assets/logo width=1 height=1 onload=alert('XSS4') />You're Pwned!\"\nSuggested mitigation\nEncode all user inputs to HTML entities\n\n",

    "reasoning": "The vulnerability involves injecting an HTML payload into the `attachments[0][fields][0][value]` parameter via the REST API. The methodology would capture this parameter during regular message-sending activity (step 1-3) and test it with simple payloads like `<img onload=...>` (step 4). Since the payload executes when viewing the message (same-channel detection via regular navigation) and requires no filter bypasses, it aligns with the 'simple payload' criteria. The parameter is directly injectable through normal API usage patterns.",

  "authnz_metadata": {
    "reason": "The vulnerability involves injecting HTML/JavaScript via API parameters, which is a client-side XSS issue rather than an authentication/authorization bypass. The proposed methodology focuses on testing AuthN/AuthZ boundaries by swapping user sessions and resource IDs, not on detecting improper input sanitization that leads to XSS.",
