    "vuln_description": "This vulnerability is a CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attack that allows an attacker to take over any user's account by tricking them into changing their password without their knowledge. The attacker crafts a malicious HTML form that submits a password change request to the vulnerable endpoint, and when the victim visits the page while authenticated, their password is changed to one controlled by the attacker.",
    "reason": "The attack involves understanding the password change flow, intercepting and modifying the request, and crafting a CSRF payload. However, these steps are straightforward for someone familiar with web security testing tools like Burp Suite. The vulnerability does not require complex application state manipulation or novel logic.",
