The methodology outlined focuses on testing authorization boundaries by swapping user sessions and resource IDs within the same application. Username enumeration and brute-forcing involve credential discovery and guessing, which are authentication (AuthN) issues rather than authorization (AuthZ) bypasses or IDOR. The methodology does not directly address credential brute-forcing or enumeration, as these are separate from testing session/resource substitution for AuthZ flaws.",
