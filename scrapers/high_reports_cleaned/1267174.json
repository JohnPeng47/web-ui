The methodology includes testing AuthN/AuthZ bypass by checking access with unauthenticated or non-privileged sessions. Since this is a direct authentication bypass using well-known default credentials (a classic AuthN flaw), it aligns with the 'AuthN/AuthZ Bypass' detection method (step d: execute actions with unauthenticated sessions). The system would detect this by attempting common default credentials during AuthN checks.",
