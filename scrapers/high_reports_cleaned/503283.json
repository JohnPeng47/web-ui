I have confirmed this with Slack to report this on Hackerone and mention the vulnerable domain.\nImpact\nBy exploiting this vulnerabiliti\u200by, an attacker can dump the real-time logs and information gained through this is critical which includes the team ID, user ID and redacted token which allows attackers to gather information which can be used later in the attack lifecycle, in order to achieve more than they could if they didn\u2019t get access to such information.\n\n",
