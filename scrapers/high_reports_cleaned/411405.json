    "vuln_description": "The vulnerability is a path traversal issue in the 'http-live-simulator' module (version 1.0.6), allowing an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server by bypassing directory restrictions. This is achieved by adding an extra slash after the URL (e.g., http://localhost:8080//../../../../etc/passwd), which bypasses the fix implemented in version 1.0.5.",
    "reason": "The attack is straightforward and does not involve multiple components, complex states, or novel logic. It simply requires knowledge of path traversal techniques and the specific bypass method (adding an extra slash). The interaction is obvious once the bypass method is known.",
