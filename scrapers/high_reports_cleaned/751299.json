  "vuln_description": "An improper authorization vulnerability allows an admin user to demote the owner of a project to an admin role, which subsequently prevents the original owner from logging into their account. This occurs because the front-end validation can be bypassed by manipulating the disabled state of the role input field via browser developer tools.",
  "reason": "The vulnerability involves a straightforward bypass of front-end controls without requiring complex interactions or deep understanding of the application's state. The attack is simple to execute once the admin privileges are obtained and the role input field is identified.",
