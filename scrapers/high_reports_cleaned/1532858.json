Enter <script>alert(2)</script> in all four parameters including Charge, Transfer, Refund, Dispute.\nClick on Update settings.\nClick on Try our new dashboard, XSS will Trigger or log out and log in again, and XSS will Trigger.\nPOC:\nAttached Video.\nImpact\nCode injected into a vulnerable application can exfiltrate data or install malware on the user's machine. Attackers can masquerade as authorized users via session cookies, allowing them to perform any action allowed by the user account.\n\n",
