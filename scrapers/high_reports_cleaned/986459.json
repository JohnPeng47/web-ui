  "vuln_description": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass email verification and potentially take over an account by using an old email address that was previously associated with the account but has since been changed. This occurs because the system fails to invalidate the old email address for authentication purposes after an email change.",
  "reason": "The vulnerability is straightforward to discover as it only requires the tester to attempt logging in with an old email address after changing it in the user settings. There are no complex interactions or states involved, and the logic flaw is relatively obvious once the email change process is understood.",

This scenario fits the methodology's test case where swapping resource_ids (emails) with existing (action, resource_id) pairs is covered by test e). The system would detect this by attempting to log in with the old email after the change, which should not be possible if proper authorization checks were in place.",
