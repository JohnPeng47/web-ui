    "reasoning": "The vulnerability involves substituting session tokens (user_session parameter) to access another user's chat resource. This directly aligns with Methodology 1 (IDOR) where (user_session, action, resource_id) tuples are tested for authorization boundaries. The automated detection steps (b/c/e) would catch this scenario by swapping sessions and verifying access to the chat endpoint (resource_type::chat_screen). The attack requires no novel authorization bypass technique beyond session substitution, which is explicitly covered by the described IDOR/AuthZ detection framework.",
