This falls under the AuthN/AuthZ Bypass vulnerability class, where no authentication is required to access resources that should be protected. The methodology described involves testing for such vulnerabilities by attempting to access resources with unauthenticated sessions or with sessions from less privileged users. Since the Grafana instance is openly accessible, it would be detected by step d) of the methodology, which tests actions with unauthenticated user sessions.",
