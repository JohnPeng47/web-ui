  "content": "\nSummary:\nThe test/integration API of the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 web services is publicly exposed: disclosing documents, emails, and credentials to what appears to be the Seaport Bid proposal system. Because I did not attempt any exploitation outside of that necessary to deem this a reportable issue, it is not clear if the data is only test generated or if the system contains production documents, credentials, etc.\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nDescription:\nWhile performing manual reconnaissance, I came across Swagger/API documentation for the \u2588\u2588\u2588 web services API at https://\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588/.\nThe API endpoint appears to have four main types of functionality:\n1) Document storage/retrieval\n2) Email template storage\n3) Email generation\n4) PDF generation\nDue to the lack of authentication on the API, the system can be easily abused by a minimally sophisticated attacker.\nImpact & Steps to Reproduce\n1) Documents stored in the system can be uploaded, modified, or deleted via the API. Per the DoD program rules on data exfil, I did not try to access the documents. You can view a listing of the documents here:\nhttps://\u2588\u2588\u2588/api/1_0/Documents\n2) Email templates can be access and modified. For example, you can view all email templates here:\nhttps://\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588/api/1_0/EmailTemplates\nYou can also add, modify, or delete templates via the API.\n3) Most importantly, you can view all of the emails that the system has sent via the API. The exact route is:\nhttps://\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588/api/1_0/EmailMessages\nThe emails are highly sensitive because they contain the activation codes needed to create a new account and access the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Proposal System at https://\u2588\u2588\u2588/Bid/.\nFor example, one of the last emails sent includes the following:\nCode 622 Bytes\n1\n2{\"resultmetadata\":[{\"emailId\":\"3f6f7fb7-167b-432d-b35b-f443709ba832\",\"systemcode\":null,\"senderEmailAddress\":\"\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Admin<DoNotReply@\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.com>\",\"acknowledgementRequested\":false,\"attachments\":[],\"tags\":[],\"tokens\":null,\"emailStatus\":\"Sent\",\"Subject\":\"Your \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Authentication Code\",\"Body\":\"Your authentication code is 373A51.

Alternatively, lock down access to the API endpoint to restricted IP addresses or networks so that it is no longer publicly accessible.\nImpact\nUpload, delete, or download sensitive files stored in the document DB\nSend, read, and modify emails from \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 admin\nLogin to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 proposal system using stolen authentication codes sent to users\n\n",
