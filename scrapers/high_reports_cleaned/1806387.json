  "content": "\nSummary:\nI discovered an issue referred to as no-redirect in a subdomain on state.gov. When you enter the page, it directs you directly to the entrance. When I examined it via burp suite, it gave 302 found, but the homepage data was showing below. When I tried it as admin, it still gave 302 found, but this time we could see the content of the admin page. this way i was able to see admin user and normal user's info. I was also able to perform many transactions. uploading files, adding categories and many more.\nSteps To Reproduce:\n1- Login to https://speakerkit.state.gov/\nand it will throw you to the page named \"spklogin\". Using the find and replace feature on burpsuite, I told it to change all requests that gave 302 found to 200 Ok, and I easily performed my operations. You will be able to do it when you watch the video.\nSupporting Material/References:\nhttps://hackerone.com/reports/1026146\nhttps://hackerone.com/reports/95441\n[attachment / reference]\n<image_0>\n[ poc / video] \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nImpact\naccess the admin page. unauthorized.\n\n",
