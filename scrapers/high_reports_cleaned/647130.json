Remember, the more detail you provide, the easier it is for us to triage and respond quickly, so be sure to take your time filling out the report!\nSummary\nStored attacks are those where the injected script is permanently stored on the target servers, such as in a database, in a message forum, visitor log, comment field, etc. The victim then retrieves the malicious script from the server when it requests the stored information. Stored XSS is also sometimes referred to as Persistent or Type-I XSS.\nSteps to reproduce\nLogin to Gitlab\nCreate a new group with xss payload payload i use = \"><img src=x onerror=prompt(123)>\nOpen Group\nTo trigger XSS you can click \"NEW PROJECT\"\nXSS Trigger\nImpact\nCan steal Cookie, Can run javascript code, etc\n\n",

This can lead to cookie theft, session hijacking, or arbitrary JavaScript execution.",

(2) The payload used (\"><img src=x onerror=prompt(123)>) is a simple, context-agnostic XSS payload without filter bypass techniques. (3) The payload execution is detectable via same-channel navigation (viewing the group or triggering the XSS via 'NEW PROJECT' button, both part of regular user workflows). (4) No advanced detection mechanisms or cross-channel analysis are required to confirm the injection.",
