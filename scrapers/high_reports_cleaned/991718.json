This password allows me to authentication to https://\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.mil.\nTo confirm this vulnerability we will first navigate to https://\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.mil, you are now prompted to type a password. We will provide an incorrect password such as 'Password'.\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\nWe can confirm the password is invalid. However, reviewing the javascript data for '\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.chunk.js' we can confirm the authentication is validated based on a hardcoded password '\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588!'.\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nWe can now confirm if we can access the staging web app using hardcoded password.\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nImpact\nBy knowing the password, it is possible to understand your password policy and structure which will encourage bruteforcing and password spray attacks in your environment.\nStep-by-step Reproduction Instructions\nNavigate to https://\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.mil.\nOpen your browser debugger by pressing F12.\nClick on Network and refresh the page.\nOpen the javascript '\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.chunk.js' and look for where the password is stored.
