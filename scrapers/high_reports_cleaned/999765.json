Which can allow me to login on websites like atlassian,github,clouflare,choopa,..etc on behalf of support_mobility@acronis.com .\nSteps To Reproduce\nLets take an example to get your github account.\nAs Github send account register verification mails from noreply@github.com\nI registered an account on acronis with same email.\nNow your support system creates ticket of emails sent to support_mobility@acronis.com .\nSo I registered an account on github and logged into my acronis account with email noreply@github.com .\nAs Acronis allowed me to see support tickets without email verification , so I was able to see support tickets easily created by noreply@acronis.com .\nOn support ticket there was an email verification link sent to noreply@github.com .\nIn this way I was able to takeover many account registered with support_mobility@acronis.com and many internal accounts that can be accessed with only @acronis.com\nPOC\nI was able to register a github account on your email address :-\n<image_0>\nResources about this vulnerability:-\nhttps://hackerone.com/reports/498964\nhttps://medium.com/intigriti/how-i-hacked-hundreds-of-companies-through-their-helpdesk-b7680ddc2d4c\nImpact\nCritical Email Takeover\nTicket Trick\nThanks for reading my report.\nBest Regards\nSayaan Alam\n\n",

The described methodologies focus on testing authorization boundaries within the same application by swapping sessions/resource_ids. However, this issue relies on cross-service email impersonation (e.g., registering noreply@github.com in Acronis to intercept GitHub verification links) and domain trust (@acronis.com internal access). These inter-service trust relationships and email-based authorization flaws would not be detected by intra-application session/resource_id testing as outlined in the methodology.",
