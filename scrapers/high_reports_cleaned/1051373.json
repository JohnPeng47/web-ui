  "vuln_description": "This is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability on reddit.com. The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code via the URL path, which is then executed when the user interacts with the 'verify email' button. This can lead to various malicious activities such as cookie theft, session hijacking, malware download, and page defacement.",
  "reason": "The vulnerability is straightforward to discover as it involves a simple injection of JavaScript code into the URL path, which is a common and well-documented attack vector. The interaction required to trigger the XSS is minimal and does not involve complex application states or novel logic.",

    "reasoning": "The XSS vulnerability is reflected via a URL path parameter. The methodology's parameter extraction phase would identify URL path segments as injectable parameters. The payload uses basic context-breaking syntax (single quotes and comma-separated JS) without complex encoding or filter bypasses, aligning with the 'simple payload' definition. Execution occurs in the same channel (direct response from the verification page) with regular navigation (clicking the link and triggering the button).",

  "authnz_metadata": {
