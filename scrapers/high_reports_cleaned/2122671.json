This matches the IDOR detection methodology where (user_session, action, resource_id) tuples are collected and tested by substituting resource_ids with existing ones (test e) in the methodology). The action (CreateOrUpdateHackerCertification) and resource_type (licenses/certifications) are part of the same application context, making it detectable.",
