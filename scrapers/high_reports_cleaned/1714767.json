The outlined methodology detects AuthN/AuthZ bypass by testing actions with unauthenticated sessions (step d) and verifying if authorization boundaries are crossed. Since the debug page lacks authentication/authorization checks entirely, the automated detection of these actions being executable without a valid session would flag this as a simple AuthN/AuthZ bypass.",
