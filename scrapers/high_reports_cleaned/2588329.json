    "content": "\nSummary:\nDear Indrive,\nIve found another valid report, the app allows any user to change the app phone number, but a flaw within the otp allows any number to be added into the account!\nWhen an user requests a phone number change inside the app, it will send a 4 digit code but if you place 0000, it will accept any number and update it into the app!!\nSteps To Reproduce:\nClick setting in the account\nClick into the phone number and change for a new one\nInput 0000 as the otp code\nPhone number added!!\nVIDEO POC\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nAt the end you can see i was trying to pick a number from my contacts but instead i just use a random phone number and works!!\nRemediation: Make sure the otp doesnt accept 0000 or other invalid codes\nLet me know if anything,\nRegards,\nPolem4rch\nImpact\nAny attacker can use the phone number for an account takeover or delete anyone account, or cancelling trips\n\n",

    "vuln_description": "The app allows any user to change the phone number associated with their account by inputting '0000' as the OTP code, bypassing the intended verification process. This flaw enables an attacker to take over any account by changing the associated phone number without proper authorization.",
    "reason": "The vulnerability involves a straightforward bypass of the OTP verification process by inputting a static code ('0000'). The steps to reproduce are simple and do not require complex interactions or understanding of multiple components. The flaw is in the OTP validation logic, which is a common area for testing, making the discovery relatively easy.",
