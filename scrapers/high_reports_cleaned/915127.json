    "content": "\nSummary:\nHi team,\nYou can move your contents via Move to button at https://app.crowdsignal.com/dashboard\nAnd when you click to Move to > My Content you will send a POST request to /dashboard like that :\n<image_0>\nactionable[] parameter's value is the content's ID. And if you change this ID to victim's content ID, you will see victim's content at My Content page. But you can't see responses or edit it. You can only change status etc if you have a free account.\nSo I found another way to takeover victim's content completely via team account.\nIn team accounts, you have another move option that named Move to another user. Basically, you can move your contents to users (in your team) .\nAnd if you follow same steps again but with Move to another user option, you can see victim's content in your team user's account.\nPlease note, content IDs are sequential, so attacker can takeover any content.\nSteps To Reproduce:\nWith Free account (limited access to victim's content)\nGo to https://app.crowdsignal.com/dashboard\nClick to checkbox on your any content and turn on Intercept at Burp Suite\nClick to Move to > My Content\nAnd change actionable[] parameter's value with victim's content ID.\nGo to My Content.\nGo to https://app.crowdsignal.com/dashboard\nClick to checkbox on your any content and turn on Intercept at Burp Suite\nClick to Move to > My Content\nAnd change actionable[] parameter's value with victim's content ID.\nGo to My Content.\nWith Team account (full access to victim's content)\nAdd your second email on https://app.crowdsignal.com/users/list-users.php and confirm it\nGo to https://app.crowdsignal.com/dashboard\nClick to checkbox on your any content and turn on Intercept at Burp Suite\nClick to Move to > Move to another user\nSelect your second account, click Move\nChange actionable[] parameter's value with victim's content ID.\nGo to your second account and check dashboard\nAdd your second email on https://app.crowdsignal.com/users/list-users.php and confirm it\nGo to https://app.crowdsignal.com/dashboard\nClick to checkbox on your any content and turn on Intercept at Burp Suite\nClick to Move to > Move to another user\nSelect your second account, click Move\nChange actionable[] parameter's value with victim's content ID.\nGo to your second account and check dashboard\nPoC video for full access to victim's content:\nImpact\nIDOR leads to takeover victim's content\nThanks,\nBugra\n\n",
