  "content": "\nSummary:\nMEW apk has improper rate limit.\nWhen we try to brute force the PIN, we are rate limited for 5 minutes after 5 or 6 attempt.\nIn my testing I found that it was checking the device's local time so by changing it we can brute force the PIN.\nSteps To Reproduce:\n1.Install MEW app from play store.\n2.Create your PIN.\n3.Now open again your MEW apk.\n4.You will be asked to enter the PIN.\n5.Try to brute force the code. You will see a message to try again after 5 min.\n6.Now change the time of your device.\n7.Observe there is no rate limit now.\nSupporting Material/References:\nImpact\nAn attacker can brute force the PIN of an user\n\n",

  "vuln_description": "The MEW app has an improper rate limit implementation for PIN attempts, which checks the device's local time. By changing the device's time, an attacker can bypass the rate limit and brute force the PIN.",
