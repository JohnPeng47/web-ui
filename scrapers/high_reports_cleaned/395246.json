  "content": "\nSummary\nThe \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 site (https://\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.mil/) allows authenticated users to submit \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 e-forms. Due to a vulnerability in this system, any authenticated user can access the full \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 e-form of any other user.\nSteps to reproduce\nIntercept an authenticated request on \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 containing an Authorization header.\nReplace the url with \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Observe that the id in the url can be incremented/decremented to view recently generated OMPFs.\nUpon submitting the request, the user's full \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 form JSON response will be sent.\nImpact\nAccess to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is possible through either a Department of Defense Self-Service logon, CAC card, or \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588password. Thus, a compromise of a single account on any of these systems would allow for unrestricted access to all \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 forms.\nThe \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 form includes the following\nPII such as SSN, DoB, addresses, etc\nPersonal remarks\nOther fields related to security clearances, education, maritial status, etc\n\n",
