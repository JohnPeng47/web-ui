  "vuln_description": "The vulnerability is a stored XSS via the 'hav' cookie parameter that bypasses WAF protections by exploiting the server's behavior of hiding double quotes. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript, leading to potential account takeover by extracting session cookies.",

    "reason": "The vulnerability involves a stored XSS via cache poisoning, which is a client-side issue rather than an authentication or authorization bypass. The methodology described focuses on testing AuthN/AuthZ boundaries by swapping user sessions and resource IDs, which does not apply to XSS vulnerabilities. XSS vulnerabilities typically require different detection methods, such as input validation testing or dynamic analysis of client-side code execution.",

  "injection_metadata": {
    "reasoning": "The vulnerability relies on a WAF bypass technique involving server-side quote removal, which requires a non-generic payload structure (</sc\"ript>). While the methodology would detect the 'hav' cookie as injectable and test with simple payloads, the specific quote-splitting bypass technique would not be covered under 'common permutations' since it requires knowledge of server-specific filtering behavior. The stored XSS trigger requires cache poisoning to manifest for other users, which depends on server caching behavior not explicitly covered in the 'regular navigation' detection phase.",
