  "vuln_description": "The m.uber.com website is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through a malformed URL parameter. The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code that gets executed in the context of the victim's browser session when they visit a specially crafted URL. This could be used to steal sensitive information like login credentials, payment details, or perform other malicious actions.",
  "reason": "This is a straightforward reflected XSS vulnerability that doesn't require complex application state manipulation or understanding of subtle component interactions. The attack vector is simple (URL parameter manipulation) and the vulnerability follows common XSS patterns without requiring novel exploitation techniques.",

    "reasoning": "The vulnerability involves a reflected XSS via URL query parameters with a simple unencoded script tag payload. The methodology would detect it because: (1) query parameters are logged during regular navigation, (2) the payload </script><script>alert(1)</script> matches 'simple payload' criteria (common XSS context manipulation without filter bypass), and (3) the injection impact is directly observable in the HTTP response body through same-channel analysis without requiring stored payload triggering or special navigation.",

    "reason": "The vulnerability involves a reflected XSS in m.uber.com where a malformed URL can be used to inject arbitrary JavaScript. This is a client-side vulnerability and does not involve authentication or authorization bypasses, nor does it involve swapping user sessions or resource IDs. The methodology described focuses on server-side AuthN/AuthZ issues and IDOR vulnerabilities, which are not applicable here.",
