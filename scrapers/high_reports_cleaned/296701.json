    "vuln_description": "The m.uber.com website is vulnerable to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through a malformed URL parameter. The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code that gets executed in the context of the victim's browser session when they visit a specially crafted URL. This could be used to steal sensitive information like login credentials, payment details, or perform other malicious actions.",
    "reason": "This is a straightforward reflected XSS vulnerability that doesn't require complex application state manipulation or understanding of subtle component interactions. The attack vector is simple (URL parameter manipulation) and the vulnerability follows common XSS patterns without requiring novel exploitation techniques.",
