    "vuln_description": "The vulnerability is an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) that allows an attacker to change the email address of any user account by manipulating the ID parameter in a profile update request. This leads to account takeover as the attacker can then use the 'forgot password' feature to gain control of the victim's account.",
