    "reasoning": "The vulnerability involves missing rate limits rather than authorization boundary violations. The methodology focuses on testing (user_session, action, resource_id) authorization checks, but this issue stems from lack of request throttling on an otherwise valid action (inviting users). The attack doesn't require privilege escalation or IDOR - it abuses a missing non-authZ control (rate limiting) against a permitted action.",
