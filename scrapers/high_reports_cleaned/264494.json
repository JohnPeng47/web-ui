  "content": "\nHello.\nA few days ago, I was looking at Roblox subdomains, and I noticed an unusual one called creatorforum.roblox.com. Upon further investigation, I visited it and saw that creatorforum.roblox.com's CNAME was a nonexistant Discourse website.\nI immediately reported to info@roblox.com, and eventually talked to Antek Baranski on the bugbounty@roblox.com email address. The issue has been fixed since reporting, but I was told to send a report here.\nIf I had a Discourse account, I could've taken over the CNAME for creatorforum.roblox.com and then it would've been a full subdomain takeover on that subdomain.\nAs mentioned earlier in the report, the issue has been resolved and as you can see the subdomain creatorforum.roblox.com no longer exists.\nThanks,\nJack\n\n",

The methodologies outlined focus on testing session/resource authorization boundaries via HTTP request manipulation (e.g., swapping user sessions or resource IDs), which does not apply to infrastructure misconfigurations like dangling DNS records. Subdomain takeovers are not detected by analyzing application-level authN/authZ logic but require monitoring DNS and third-party service dependencies.",
