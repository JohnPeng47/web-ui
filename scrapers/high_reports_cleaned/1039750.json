  "vuln_description": "The Intense Debate comment system is vulnerable to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via image tags with malicious 'onload' attributes. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of other users' sessions, potentially leading to cookie theft, session hijacking, or phishing attacks.",
  "reason": "The vulnerability is straightforward to discover as it involves a basic XSS payload in a common HTML attribute ('onload'). The attack requires no complex application state manipulation or understanding of subtle interactions between components. The only prerequisite (enabling images in comments) is a standard feature with no obfuscation.",

    "reason": "The vulnerability involves stored XSS in the Intense Debate comment system, which is a client-side issue and not directly related to authentication or authorization boundaries. The proposed methodologies focus on testing AuthN/AuthZ bypasses and IDORs by manipulating user sessions and resource IDs, which are server-side concerns. XSS vulnerabilities are typically detected through input validation testing, not session/resource ID manipulation.",
    "is_detectable": false
  },
  "injection_metadata": {
    "reasoning": "The vulnerability involves injecting a basic HTML payload (`<img ... onload=alert()>`) into a comment field. The methodology would log HTTP requests during regular navigation (e.g., submitting a comment), identify the comment text as an injectable parameter, and test it with simple payloads like the one provided. Since the payload execution (alert) occurs when viewing the comment via regular navigation (same channel, same application), and the payload does not require custom filter bypasses, it aligns with the 'simple payload' criteria. The stored XSS trigger is within the same application and detectable through standard user/admin workflows.",
