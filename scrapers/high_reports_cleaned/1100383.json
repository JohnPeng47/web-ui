    "content": "\nSummary:\nThe given application has a form to fill in the details of the candidates in order to seek admission to various courses. The application has the functionality to submit the given form and provide a registration confirmation to the candidate with their name on the page. By cycling the parameter we can enumerate all the applicant's names who had applied for the specific courses.\nDescription:\nWe can cycle the numeric value after the registration process and enumerate all the candidate names.\nImpact\nThe attacker might carry out targeted attacks against the given organization by exfiltrating details from the candidates. The attacker can also find the candidates easily on social media sites to carry out further attacks.\nStep-by-step Reproduction Instructions\nFill in the form in order to apply/register for the courses online https://www2.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588/asops/CESET/DotNet/(S(zxfdh3222tuxim4qkyddqkc4))/Register.aspx?s=1&c=SOC-E\nAfter the form is filled, the confirmation messaged is displayed in a URL as https://www2.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588/asops/CESET/DotNet/(S(y4xw2rqkzk1zzzej0mu2atng))/RegistrationConfirmation.aspx?stu=490504\nThe attacker can cycle the stu value from the beginning and enumerate thousand of candidates enrolled for the courses.\nHere we have automated the attack in order to get user details in a short period of time. Please refer to the screenshot below having the results.\nSuggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\nThe application shall generate hashed values instead of numeric values so that the attacker cannot guess the user details.\nImpact\nThe attacker might carry out targeted attacks against the given organization by exfiltrating details from the candidates.
