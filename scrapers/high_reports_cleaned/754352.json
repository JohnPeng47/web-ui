  "vuln_description": "A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in WordPress 5.3 allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the title of a post. When the post is viewed, the script executes in the context of the victim's browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies or perform other malicious actions.",
  "reason": "The vulnerability is straightforward to discover as it involves a simple injection of a common XSS payload into a visible field (post title) without any need for complex interactions or state manipulation. The attack does not require multiple components or novel logic, making it easy to identify and exploit.",

The methodology would log this POST request parameter during regular post creation navigation. The payload requires no filter bypasses and executes when viewing the post (same application context through regular navigation). Detection occurs through same-channel response inspection of the stored payload's execution.",

The proposed methodologies focus on testing AuthN/AuthZ and IDOR vulnerabilities by swapping user sessions or resource IDs, which does not apply to XSS vulnerabilities.",
