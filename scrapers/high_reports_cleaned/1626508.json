The attachments leaked are banks taxes, contracts, PII such as full address and mobile number, emails, etc. The vulnerable URL is at [https://www.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588/Download.aspx?id=4675]\nSteps To Reproduce:\n[add details for how we can reproduce the issue]\nGo to this URL [https://www.\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588/Download.aspx?id=4675]\nAdd any desired id\nthen you will see a variety of sensitive files and contracts which contain PIIs and other classified documents\nImpact\nAn unauthenticated attacker is able to obtain PII of users and soldiers also an attacker is able to leak classified documents\n\n",
