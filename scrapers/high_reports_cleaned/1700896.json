This falls under AuthN/AuthZ bypass, as the methodology includes testing for unauthenticated access (step d). The detection method for AuthN bypass would involve substituting an unauthenticated session and verifying access. Here, the credentials are default, so an attacker bypasses proper authentication via known defaults. The methodology's step d (testing actions with unauthenticated sessions) would detect this if the system allows access with default credentials without requiring proper user authentication.",
