    "reasoning": "The vulnerability involves bypassing 2FA by manipulating a session cookie after initial authentication but before completing the 2FA challenge. The described methodology focuses on testing session/resource substitution and unauthenticated access checks, but doesn't explicitly account for mid-authentication state manipulation via cookie deletion during a multi-step auth flow. While session cookies are tracked, the methodology doesn't specify testing partial authentication states (post-credentials/pre-2FA) by session cookie manipulation.",
