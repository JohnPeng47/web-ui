  "content": "\nSummary:\nI have discovered an XSS vulnerability regarding the mod notes feature. Specifically, the XSS payload executes when the victim removes a post in a subreddit and opens up the mod notes of the attacker.\nSteps To Reproduce:\nThe attacker creates a new post with the title containing the XSS payload.\nThe victim (mods of the subreddit) then must remove your post.\nThe payload executes when a victim (subreddit mod) opens up your mod notes. Sometimes, the mod notes are displayed when the victim hovers on your profile (this is true when a recent mod action has been taken on the user).\nSupporting Material/References:\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nImpact\nImpact Below:\n\n",

The payload may also execute when hovering over the attacker's profile if recent mod actions have been taken.",

The components (post creation, removal, mod notes) are standard features with predictable interactions.",

  "injection_metadata": {
    "reasoning": "The XSS vulnerability involves injecting a payload into a post title (an injectable parameter) which triggers when mod notes are viewed. The methodology would detect this because: 1) Title parameters would be logged as injectable during regular navigation, 2) Simple payloads could be tested in titles without filter bypasses, and 3) Execution verification occurs through same-channel navigation (mods viewing mod notes via regular UI interactions). Though the trigger requires a specific mod action (post removal), the methodology accounts for stored XSS scenarios where payloads manifest in different UI elements accessible through normal user workflows.",
