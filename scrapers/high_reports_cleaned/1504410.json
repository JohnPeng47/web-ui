Specifically, the XSS payload executes when the victim removes a post in a subreddit and opens up the mod notes of the attacker.\nSteps To Reproduce:\nThe attacker creates a new post with the title containing the XSS payload.\nThe victim (mods of the subreddit) then must remove your post.\nThe payload executes when a victim (subreddit mod) opens up your mod notes. Sometimes, the mod notes are displayed when the victim hovers on your profile (this is true when a recent mod action has been taken on the user).\nSupporting Material/References:\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nImpact\nImpact Below:\n\n",
