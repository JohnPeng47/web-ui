You can now view current/past requests.\nClicking on these requests seems to allow an adversary to update/create changes/send e-mails, as well as attach files to the requests. I did not test these features as I did not want to impact existing requests, however I believe the ability to view these requests is enough of a security issue by itself as it allows an attacker to identify hardware/software specifications for NIPR/SIPR assets, as well as identifying justifications for the requests (upcoming TDYs, etc.)\nSuggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\nRestrict access to this endpoint to only allow administrators to view requests as well as allowing users to view their own requests or the requests of users in the same workgroup.\nImpact\nAn adversary can identify hardware/software specifications of NIPRNET/SIPRNET assets. Additionally, an adversary can gather intel based on justification requirements in the requests (upcoming TDYs, deployments, mission posture due to COVID, etc.)\n\n",
