  "vuln_description": "The vulnerability involves a subdomain takeover where a DNS entry points to a non-existent cloud storage bucket. An attacker can claim this bucket by creating it with the same name, thereby gaining control over the subdomain and potentially serving malicious content or phishing pages.",
