The methodology described focuses on authentication and authorization bypasses (IDOR and AuthN/AuthZ bypasses) by manipulating user sessions, actions, and resource IDs. Since XSS is a client-side vulnerability that does not involve bypassing authentication or authorization mechanisms, it falls outside the scope of the described methodology.",
