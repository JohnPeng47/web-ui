This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2024-26141.\nVersions Affected: >= 1.3.0. Not affected: < 1.3.0 Fixed Versions: 3.0.9.1, 2.2.8.1\nImpact\nCarefully crafted Range headers can cause a server to respond with an unexpectedly large response. Responding with such large responses could lead to a denial of service issue.\nVulnerable applications will use the Rack::File middleware or the Rack::Utils.byte_ranges methods (this includes Rails applications).\n\n",
