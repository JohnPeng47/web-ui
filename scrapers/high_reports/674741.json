  "vuln_description": "The examples directory on the target website is publicly accessible, leading to multiple vulnerabilities including session manipulation, internal IP disclosure, source code disclosure, and insecure cookie handling. The most critical issue is the session manipulation vulnerability which could lead to account takeover due to global session handling.",

The discovery requires no special knowledge or complex interactions, as the examples are directly accessible and their implications are straightforward.",
