  "vuln_description": "The vulnerability involves hardcoded Twitter API keys (consumer key and consumer secret) in the application's resources file. These keys are meant for developer use only and should not be exposed in the application. Exposure of these keys allows unauthorized access to Twitter's API, potentially leading to misuse of the application's Twitter integration.",
  "reason": "The discovery of this vulnerability is straightforward as it involves inspecting a common file (strings.xml) in the application package, which is a standard practice in mobile app security testing. The steps to reproduce are simple and do not involve complex interactions or states.",
