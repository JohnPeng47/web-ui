Just paste this URL and login, XSS will automatically execute.\nTherefore, it will have a high impact, because before XSS is executed, the application will ask the user to login.\nThe attacker can execute JS code. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nDocuments related to Impact\nhttps://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/reflected\nhttps://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/exploiting\nRecommendation\nRevisit the entire application and validate the user input at server side.\nSanitize the data collected from input fields before further processing.\nFilter out special and meta-characters from user input.\nBest regards,\n@dat\n\n",
