  "content": "\nHello Team\nAbstract:-\nA Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability was found in the MailPoet Newsletters plugin. This issue allows an attacker to perform a wide variety of actions, such as stealing Administrators' session tokens, or performing arbitrary actions on their behalf. In order to exploit this issue, the attacker has to lure/force a logged on WordPress Administrator into opening a URL provided by an attacker.\nIntroduction:-\nThe MailPoet Newsletters plugin allows a WordPress administrator to create newsletters, automated emails, post notifications and autoresponders. A Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability was found in the MailPoet Newsletters plugin. This issue allows an attacker to perform a wide variety of actions, such as stealing Administrators' session tokens, or performing arbitrary actions on their behalf. In order to exploit this issue, the attacker has to lure/force a logged on WordPress Administrator into opening a URL provided by an attacker.\nProof of concept:-\nHave an authenticated admin visit the URL:-\nhttps://business-blog.zomato.com//?wysija-page=1&controller=subscribers&action=wysija_outter&encodedForm=eyJmb3JtIjoiUHduIiwiYWZ0ZXJfd2lkZ2V0IjoiPHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgnWFNTJyk8L3NjcmlwdD4ifQ==\nThe encodedForm parameter is the base64 encoded string:\n{\"form\":\"Pwn\",\"after_widget\":\"<script>alert('XSS)</script>\"}\nA pop-up box should appear, meaning the JavaScript contained in the request_id request parameter was executed by the browser.\n<image_0>\nFix:-\nThis issue is resolved in MailPoet Newsletters version 2.7.3.\nRegards,\nSanthosh\n\n",
