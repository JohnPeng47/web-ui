    [
      1,
      "Identify a Perl script that uses the `regcomp` function with a pattern that includes a backslash followed by a non-digit character (e.g., `\\N`)."

      2,
      "Execute the script to trigger the heap-buffer-overflow read vulnerability in the `S_grok_bslash_N` function."
    ]
  ],
  "vuln_description": "The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow read in the `S_grok_bslash_N` function within the `regcomp` function of Perl. This can lead to potential information leaks, such as exposing secret variables or source codes, due to improper handling of certain backslash sequences in regular expressions.",
  "reason": "The vulnerability involves a single component (the `regcomp` function) and a specific, non-obvious interaction with backslash sequences in regular expressions. The discovery requires knowledge of Perl's regex handling but does not involve multiple components or complex state manipulation.",
