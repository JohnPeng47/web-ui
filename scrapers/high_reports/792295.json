    "content": "\nHello there how are you doing ?\nGo to sign up page and enter a new phone number and you will be redirected to https://bumble.com/registration/confirm-phone .\nYou will receive a easy breakable 4 digit OTP Code .\nI waited for about 4 hours and the OTP did not expired , This shows that the OTP can be easily bruteforced even having the rate limiting , assuming rate limiting is implemented as this is an old program .\nThe OTP can be bruteforced , by changing IP via VPN and as the OTP does not expires for a long time it gives sufficient time , to get the actual OTP Code also the OTP is only of 4 digits , So it only requires 10,000 requests .\nFor Solving of this issue , Captcha Implementation is recommended .\nPOC - Please check screenshots\nImpact\nImpact\nRegistering with a different person mobile number without actual verification .\nImpersonating other's identity .\n\n",
