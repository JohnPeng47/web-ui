By crafting a specific URL, an attacker can interact with the ColdFusion Administrator utilities without proper authentication.",
  "reason": "The vulnerability involves a straightforward URL manipulation to bypass access controls. The attack does not require multiple components, complex state manipulation, or novel logic. The URL construction is simple and the interaction is direct.",
