  "content": "\nSummary:\nIn a nutshell, an authentication bypass exploits weak authentication mechanisms to allow a hacker to access your systems and data.In a nutshell, an authentication bypass exploits weak authentication mechanisms to allow a hacker to access your systems and data\nSteps To Reproduce:\n1.I was going to the site: \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and on the home page I clicked on personal and the site redirected me to another site which is: \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and on this site on which I was redirected I saw \"link your NIN\" and I went to this site and after listing I found an impressive thing which is the Tiny filemanager and to authenticate myself I bypass it with default credentials to access it.\nThe default credentials are: Login Details: \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 | user/12345\nand I had access to the panel and I had privileges like modify, upload, delete\n## Supporting Material/References:\n[list any additional material (e.g. screenshots, logs, etc.)]\n[attachment / reference]\nImpact\nThe impact of authentication vulnerabilities can be very severe. Once an attacker has either bypassed authentication or has brute-forced their way into another user's account, they have access to all the data and functionality that the compromised account has.\n\n",
