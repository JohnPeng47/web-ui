  "vuln_description": "CVE-2019-5736 is a container escape vulnerability that allows an attacker to gain root access on the host system by exploiting a flaw in the runC container runtime. The vulnerability occurs when a malicious container can overwrite the host's runC binary, which is then executed with root privileges when the container is started or attached to.",
  "reason": "This vulnerability involves understanding the interaction between container runtimes (runC), Docker, and Kubernetes, as well as the subtle way in which the runC binary can be hijacked. The attacker needs to manipulate the container's execution flow to overwrite the host's runC binary, which requires deep knowledge of container internals and the runtime environment.",
