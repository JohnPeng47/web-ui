  "vuln_description": "This vulnerability is an SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) in Apache HTTP Server on Windows when mod_rewrite is used in server/vhost context. It allows an attacker to potentially leak NTLM hashes to a malicious server via crafted requests.",
  "reason": "The vulnerability involves understanding the interaction between mod_rewrite rules and Windows-specific NTLM authentication, which is a non-obvious interaction. Additionally, the attacker needs to craft specific requests to exploit this interaction, adding to the complexity.",
