I\u2019ve done a fresh install of node within the last 7 days\nIII) Whether I\u2019m one of many infected with this malware, I am not aware of using the event-stream package that was infected previously\nThanks for any help, Windows Defender tells me the threat is blocked.\nAdam\nImpact\nThis threat can perform a number of actions of a malicious hacker's choice\n\n",
