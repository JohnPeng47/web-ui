Maston has the ability to create new accounts, change passwords. delete accounts and delete tweets as referenced within their API documentation here with the Admin API tokens - https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/accounts/\nSupporting Material/References:\nPlease find attached the conversation where the API token was accidentaly leaked.\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nImpact\nSummary:\nThe exposure of Admin Mastodon API tokens represents a critical security vulnerability with the potential for severe consequences. These tokens grant unauthorized individuals comprehensive access to the Mastodon server, allowing them to manipulate user data, spread malicious content, and compromise the integrity of the platform. Immediate action is required to mitigate this risk and protect both the system and its users.\n\n",
