  "vuln_description": "This vulnerability involves the Log4j library (CVE-2021-44228), which allows Remote Code Execution (RCE) via a crafted JNDI lookup in the log message. The attacker can exploit this by sending a specially crafted request to a vulnerable application, which then executes arbitrary code.",

    "reason": "The Log4j vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228) involves a Remote Code Execution (RCE) exploit via a Java package (Log4j) and does not directly involve authentication or authorization bypass within the same application context. The proposed methodologies focus on detecting AuthN/AuthZ and IDOR vulnerabilities by manipulating user sessions, actions, and resource IDs within the same application. Since the Log4j exploit is unrelated to these scenarios, it would not be detectable using the described methodologies.",
