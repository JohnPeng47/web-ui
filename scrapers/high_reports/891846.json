  "title": "CVE-2020-9383 Floppy OOB read",
  "content": "\nA vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel up to 5.5.6 (Operating System) and classified as critical. Affected by this issue is the function set_fdc of the file drivers/block/floppy.c. The manipulation with an unknown input leads to a memory corruption vulnerability (Out-of-Bounds). Using CWE to declare the problem leads to CWE-125. Impacted is confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\nThe weakness was disclosed 02/25/2020 by Jordy Zomer (GitHub Repository). The advisory is shared for download at github.com. This vulnerability is handled as CVE-2020-9383 since 02/24/2020. The attack needs to be approached locally.\nReferences:\nhttp://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-03/msg00039.html\nhttps://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/2e90ca68b0d2f5548804f22f0dd61145516171e3\nhttps://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20200313-0003/\nImpact\nA local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information.\n\n",
