The methodology described focuses on authentication and authorization bypasses (AuthN/AuthZ) and IDOR vulnerabilities by manipulating user sessions and resource IDs within the same application. Since this RCE does not involve session or resource ID manipulation, but rather exploits a known vulnerability in a third-party component, it falls outside the scope of the described detection methodology.",
