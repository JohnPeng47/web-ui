The attacker sends a malformed header to confuse the server's request parsing logic, potentially leading to request smuggling where the server interprets the request differently than intended.",
    "reason": "The attack requires knowledge of HTTP protocol intricacies and the ability to craft a malformed header. However, once the header manipulation is understood, the attack is relatively straightforward to execute.",
