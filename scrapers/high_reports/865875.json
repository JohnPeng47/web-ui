    "vuln_description": "The vulnerability involves multiple security issues including XMLRPC exploitation for brute-force attacks and Denial of Service (DOS), along with sensitive information disclosure via installer logs. The XMLRPC endpoint allows for brute-force attacks once the admin username is obtained from the publicly accessible installer logs. Additionally, the pingback feature in XMLRPC can be misused to launch DOS attacks.",
    "reason": "The attack involves multiple components (XMLRPC exploitation, information disclosure from logs, brute-forcing, and DOS) but each step is straightforward and well-documented in security literature. The interactions between components are not subtle, and the attack does not require manipulating complex application states or novel logic.",
