  "content": "\nHi,\nAfter some research, I found a leak on GitHub that might lead to accessing sensitive data of employees or clients (not sure based on the code). There is also a SAP S-user to access a cloud based HANA service. I have not confirmed what kind of data is in there to avoid potential legal issues. I will let you guys figure that out ;)\nI am not sure who is the owner of the repository, but I can tell you that the SAP credentials are for someone at Starbucks China.\nhttps://github.com/karaskay/personalware\nSome interesting files:\nhttps://github.com/karaskay/personalware/blob/989723f896eec67a50a9b9f59ceefc48a046049b/python/PycharmProjects/JMS36/testhttprequestjson.py\n(SAP Cloud HANA credentials)\nhttps://github.com/karaskay/personalware/blob/989723f896eec67a50a9b9f59ceefc48a046049b/python/PycharmProjects/JMS36/JMSproducerforsurvey.py\n(starbuckstest domain credentials)\nThanks!\nImpact\nHigh potential of an unauthorized access to PII data\n\n",
