  "vuln_description": "The vulnerability is a Log4j Remote Code Execution (RCE) issue in the Solr application. By logging untrusted or user-controlled data with a vulnerable version of Log4J, an attacker can execute arbitrary code remotely. This includes exploiting logged errors, exception traces, or authentication failures where user input is included.",

The steps are minimal and do not require complex interactions or state manipulation. The vulnerability is widely documented, making it easier to discover and exploit.",
