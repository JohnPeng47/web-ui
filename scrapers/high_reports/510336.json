  "vuln_description": "An uninitialized read vulnerability in the exif_process_IFD_in_TIFF function of PHP's EXIF extension allows memory disclosure when processing specially crafted TIFF images in 32-bit PHP builds. This can lead to sensitive information leakage from the application's memory space.",
