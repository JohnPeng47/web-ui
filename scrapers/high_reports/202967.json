  "content": "\nReported to the project maintainers in 2016. The function sig_print() did receive a correct caplen parameter value but didn't use it correctly which could result in a read outside of buffer. Fixed by https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/tcpdump/commit/5d214e36eed3565fbdc0f9b527bbc33a6bb63972.\n\n",

  "vuln_description": "The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the ATM parser of tcpdump before version 4.9.0, specifically in the sig_print() function in print-atm.c. The function receives a correct caplen parameter but does not use it properly, leading to a potential read outside the buffer bounds. This could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code.",
  "reason": "The vulnerability involves a straightforward buffer overflow due to incorrect parameter handling. It does not require multiple components, complex state manipulation, or novel logic. The issue is localized to a single function and its misuse of a parameter.",
