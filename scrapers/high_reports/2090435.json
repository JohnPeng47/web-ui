  "vuln_description": "This vulnerability is an access control bypass in Adobe ColdFusion, specifically a path traversal issue that allows attackers to reach restricted endpoints by manipulating the URL path. The vulnerability bypasses the fix for CVE-2023-29298 by using a crafted path (/hax/..CFIDE/wizards/common/utils.cfc) to access the utils.cfc endpoint, which should be restricted.",
  "reason": "The attack involves a straightforward path traversal technique that does not require multiple components, complex state manipulation, or novel logic. The vulnerability is a known bypass of a previous CVE, making it easier to discover once the initial vulnerability was publicized.",
