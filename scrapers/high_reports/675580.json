  "vuln_description": "An out-of-bounds memory read vulnerability exists in PHP's EXIF extension when processing user comments in EXIF data. When parsing EXIF information via exif_read_data(), specially crafted data can cause the function to read past the allocated buffer, potentially leading to information disclosure or application crash.",
  "reason": "The vulnerability involves a straightforward buffer read operation without proper bounds checking, which is a common type of memory safety issue. The attack requires no complex interactions between components or manipulation of application state. The vulnerability pattern (missing bounds check) is well-known in security research.",
