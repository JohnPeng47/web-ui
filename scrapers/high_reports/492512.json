  "content": "\nHi,\nI want to submit my report https://hackerone.com/reports/473811 for the Internet Bug Bounty.\nSnyk's writeup: https://snyk.io/blog/severe-security-vulnerability-in-bowers-zip-archive-extraction\nMy assessment on why this report might be eligible:\nTo qualify, vulnerabilities must meet the following criteria:\nBe implementation agnostic: vulnerability is present in implementations from multiple vendors or a vendor with dominant market share. Do not send us vulnerabilities that only impact a single website, product, or project.\nBower is one of the top package managers for nodejs ecosystem with many major companies dependent on it as cited by https://stackshare.io/stackups/bower-vs-npm-vs-yarn\nBe open source: finding manifests itself in at least one popular open source project. \u2714\ufe0f\nIn addition, vulnerabilities should meet most of the following criteria:\nBe widespread: vulnerability manifests itself across a wide range of products, or impacts a large number of end users\nBower has ~2 million monthly downloads according to Snyk's report with official npm stats showing 355k+ downloads the past week.\n<image_0>\nHave critical impact: vulnerability has extreme negative consequences for the general public. \u2714\ufe0f\nBe novel: vulnerability is new or unusual in an interesting way. \uff5e\nWhat do you think?\nRegards,\nSkynet (skyn3t)\nImpact\nWriting arbitrary files on the system\n\n",

  "vuln_description": "The vulnerability in Bower allows arbitrary file writes due to improper validation of symlinks during package extraction. An attacker can craft a malicious package containing symlinks that point to sensitive system locations. When the package is extracted by Bower, these symlinks are followed, potentially allowing the attacker to overwrite critical system files.",
  "reason": "The attack involves understanding how package managers handle symlinks during extraction and crafting a malicious package that exploits this behavior. While the concept of symlink attacks is known, the specific implementation flaw in Bower's extraction logic requires some insight into the package manager's internals.",
