    "vuln_description": "This vulnerability allows an attacker to spoof emails from Nextcloud's domain (e.g., support@nextcloud.com) using a third-party service (emkei.cz). The spoofed email appears legitimate to the recipient, potentially enabling phishing or social engineering attacks.",
    "reason": "The vulnerability is straightforward to exploit using publicly available email spoofing tools, requiring no deep understanding of Nextcloud's internal systems or complex interactions. The attack relies on basic email protocol weaknesses (lack of proper SPF/DKIM/DMARC enforcement) rather than novel or intricate logic.",
