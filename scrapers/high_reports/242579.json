  "vuln_description": "The vulnerability involves remote server crashes, double-free, memory leaks, and other memory corruption issues in OpenVPN's certificate processing and TLS handling. These can be exploited by an attacker to cause denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code.",
  "reason": "The vulnerability requires understanding of OpenVPN's certificate processing and TLS stack internals, but the attack vectors are relatively straightforward once these are known. The complexity arises from the need to craft specific inputs to trigger the memory corruption, but the components involved are not excessively numerous or interdependent.",
