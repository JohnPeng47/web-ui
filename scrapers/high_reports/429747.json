    "vuln_description": "The vulnerability is a web cache poisoning attack where an attacker can poison the cache of the website (https://help.nextcloud.com) by injecting malicious HTTP headers (X-Forwarded-Host) containing XSS payloads or malware URLs. This can lead to stored XSS attacks, defacement, or phishing, and may cause browsers to block the site.",
    "reason": "The attack involves manipulating HTTP headers to poison the web cache, which is a straightforward technique once the vulnerability is known. The interaction between the HTTP headers and the cache mechanism is not particularly subtle or complex, and the attack does not require novel logic or deep understanding of the application's state.",
