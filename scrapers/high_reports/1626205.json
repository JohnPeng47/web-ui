By hosting their own MySQL database server and providing its credentials during the WordPress installation, an attacker can complete the installation process without needing valid credentials for the target system's database. This results in full administrative access to the WordPress instance.",

The interaction between these components is not subtle or complex, and the logic is commonly understood in WordPress installations.",
