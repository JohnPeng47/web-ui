Get yours from the AppLovin UI\".\nGithub Link:- https://github.com/mopub/mopub-android-mediation/blob/72804166ec9f3b79cc0dcfa96bd8c813f3252794/Testing/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml#L60\nGoogle Ads SDK reference link:- https://developers.google.com/admob/android/mediation/applovin\nThanks\nAnshuman Pattnaik\nImpact\nSo if it's a production API key then it shouldn't be shown publicly in Github repo otherwise it can be used by other developers as it's a company property the API key should be secure as it's a monetize API key.\n\n",
