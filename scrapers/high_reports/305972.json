  "vuln_description": "The vulnerability is an infinite loop in the `gdImageCreateFromGifCtx` function of the GD library, which can be triggered by a malicious GIF file. This causes the server to exhaust its resources when processing the image, potentially leading to denial of service. All PHP versions using the affected GD library are vulnerable.",
  "reason": "The vulnerability involves a straightforward exploitation of a parsing flaw in the GD library's GIF processing function. The attack does not require multiple components, complex state manipulation, or novel logic. The malicious GIF file is the sole component needed to trigger the infinite loop.",
