    [
      1,

      "Craft a malicious regular expression pattern that triggers a heap buffer overflow during compilation (regcomp phase)."
    ]
  ],
  "vuln_description": "The vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow in Perl's regcomp (regular expression compilation) function, which can be exploited by crafting a malicious regular expression pattern. This overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution (RCE) due to improper bounds checking when processing certain regex patterns.",
  "reason": "The vulnerability involves understanding the internals of Perl's regex compilation process and crafting a pattern that triggers the overflow. While the attack is straightforward once the pattern is known, discovering the exact pattern requires deep knowledge of Perl's regex engine internals.",
