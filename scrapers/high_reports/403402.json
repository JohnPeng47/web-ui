The methodology described focuses on detecting IDOR and AuthN/AuthZ bypass vulnerabilities within the same application by testing different user sessions and resource IDs. However, the Jenkins vulnerability is a misconfiguration that allows unauthenticated users to execute arbitrary code, which is not covered by the described methodology as it doesn't involve user sessions or resource IDs within the same application context.",
