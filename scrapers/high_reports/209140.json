    "content": "\nSummary:\nHi Hackerone Team,\nBefore i reported that email forwarding of private can be enumerated and any user join to private program here #201369 , but this seems by design, but now it i found a related issue which can cause a security impact on private program because the email forwarding response of HackerOne did not expire after first use.\nDescription (Include Impact):\nIf a user Quits to a private program, this user can rejoined without the knowledge of private program owners, also you can check further if the user become Banned it seems that the linked on email still not expire and this can cause security implication if the banned user can rejoined to the program without the knowledge of the program owner, for reproduction steps please see below.\nSteps To Reproduce\nSend a test mail to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 which is private and have email forwarding setup.\nClick and follow the link on the email response and you become auto invited to the program (intentional).\nNO NOT submit the test report (means the email link already used, but you did not continue to submit the report, you are now participants to the program).\nNow Quit to the program.\nGo to email and click the same link and you can get back without requesting another link (using submit report via email forwarding)\nLink on the email response of forwarding feature should expire after first use\n{F164319}\nImpact:\nWhen the user quits, or if the program owner dicided to remove/banned the user on participating private program, the user should not get back unless the program owners decide to un-banned and the user/researcher gets invited again.\nMitigation:\nThe email forwarding feature should expire after it's first use, do not allow the attacker to reused the link to join to the program.\nPlease ask if you need more information.\nRegards\nJapz\n\n",
