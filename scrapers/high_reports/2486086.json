    "vuln_description": "A two-factor authentication bypass allows unauthorized access to private program details and participant information by manipulating the authentication setup process. By initially setting up two-factor authentication without an account, a user can accept invitations and view sensitive data. Disabling and re-enabling two-factor authentication with an email account then triggers the system to re-send invitations, allowing the user to access the same data again.",
    "reason": "The vulnerability involves a non-obvious interaction between the two-factor authentication setup process and the invitation system. The attacker must understand that setting up two-factor authentication without an account allows bypassing the intended security checks, and that reconfiguring it with an email account resets the invitation state. This requires knowledge of both the authentication flow and the invitation handling logic.",
