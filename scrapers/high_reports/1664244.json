  "vuln_description": "The vulnerability is a path traversal issue where unsanitized input from a CLI argument is directly used in the io.ioutil.ReadFile function, allowing an attacker to read arbitrary files on the system by manipulating the input to include path traversal sequences.",
  "reason": "The vulnerability is straightforward to discover as it involves a direct flow of unsanitized input into a file read operation, a common and well-documented security issue. The attack does not require multiple components, complex interactions, or novel logic.",
