  "vuln_description": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to perform an account takeover of MTN user accounts due to the lack of rate limiting on OTP (One-Time Password) code requests. This enables brute-force attacks where an attacker can send unlimited OTP requests to guess the correct code and gain access to the account.",
  "reason": "The vulnerability is straightforward to exploit as it only requires sending multiple OTP requests without any restrictions. The lack of rate limiting is a common security flaw and does not involve complex interactions or novel logic.",
