I can now serve content on this domain, obtain a TLS certificate for this domain, etc.\nIf any customers or servers are pointing to anything within this domain, I could serve them arbitrary/malicious content. I could also use this in case your domain whitelists your own domain for OAuth, or if there are cookies scoped to the entire domain.
