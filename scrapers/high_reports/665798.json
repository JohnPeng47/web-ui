  "content": "\nSummary:\nThe MCD contracts contain different mechanisms for accumulating rates in different\ncontracts, namely pot and jug corresponding to the cost of a loan and interest\nearned on savings. Because these rates are not synchronised, and depend on the\ncall to the drip method to be calculated, it's possible to game the system\nto obtain returns on DAI \"savings\" that exist only within a transaction.\nThis means all holders of ETH/gems can costlessly and risklessly earn interest\nfrom the pot contract without ever holding DAI for any amount of time.\nThis leads to inflation of the DAI supply and transfer of value to attackers.\nDetailed Description of the Attack Mechanism\nOne of the novel features introduced in the MC contracts is the concept of DSR\n(DAI Savings Rate) which incentivises investors to hold DAI, by allowing them\nto earn interest on DAI deposits in the pot contract.\nNormally that doesn't result in overall inflation of the DAI supply,\nas the only ways of obtaining the DAI to deposit on the \"savings account\" is by\neither acquiring a CDP (Collateralised Debt Position) or buying DAI from someone\nelse. As repaying a CDP will require an amount of DAI increasing with time, the\noverall economic effect is a net increase in DAI value.\nIn practice, however, both the Stability Fee rates and the DSR rate accrue at discrete\nmoments in time (rather than continuously), whenever a user calls the method\ndrip on the jug or pot contracts. As these methods are not synchronised\nbetween the jug and pot contracts it is possible, by carefully sequencing\nmethod calls to perform a transaction with the following steps:\nTransform the ETH/token into gem balance, using the join contract.\nCreate a CDP urn (vat.frob), obtaining the maximum amount of DAI from the gem balance.\nDeposit the resulting DAI balance into pot (join method).\nUpdate accumulated DSR rate (pot.drip).\nWithdraw DAI from pot (exit method), obtaining the DAI deposited in 3 plus interest.\nRepay CDP (again, vat.frob), getting back the gem balance.\nTransform back the gem balance into ETH/token.\nAt first glance the attack might not seem very practical, since there's no way\nto guarantee that no other transaction with call pot.drip in the same block, and\nthat the time between calls to drip might be just a few seconds, earning a minimal\namount of interest.\nIn practice, a balance of several million USD worth of tokens would be enough to\nobtain interest payments larget than the gas cost of each call -- this could be\neasily crowdsourced in a trustless contract that splits the profits according to\nsize of ETH/token deposits by participants, or easily obtained by some individual\ninvestors (e.g. exchanges).\nEven if the attack doesn't earn an interest in every instance (due to pot.drip\nhaving already been called in the same block), a random portion of successful\noccurrences would be enough to make executing it repeatedly profitable. Moreover,\nthe crowdsourcing contract could obtain miner collaboration by paying them a portion of profits or\nextremely high fees.\nIf a crowdsourced attacker is correctly built and publicised, nothing prevents\nevery single ETH/token holder from depositing their holdings in it, and profitably\nparticipating (with minimal cost and no risk) in a continuous attack on the MCD contracts,\nearning interest on a total balance worth billions USD -- and considerably inflating\nthe DAI supply.\nThe attack will become clearer by inspecting a concrete example.\nReproducing the Attack - Example Crowdsourcer Contract\nPlease find attached the file antivat.t.sol which includes an example crowdsourcer\ncontract (AntiVat) capable of accepting ETH deposits from users, and executing\nthe CDP+DSR attack (grabFreeDai method). The contract also distributes profits\nproportionally between contributors.\nThe contract could be easily extended to support other gems and to provide an\nincentive to the miner.\nPlease note that this attacker contract is provided merely as an example for\nhelping in reproducing the bug.\nPossible Fix\nAs a suggested fix, calling pot.drip from within the call to vat.frob would\nrender the attack impossible (interest would always be zero).\nPlease note that I make no claim that the above is the best way of fixing the issue.\nThe suggested fix is provided only as proof that this is a fixable bug in the\ncontracts.\nImpact Analysis\nPlease refer to the \"Impact Analysis\" field below for a detailed analysis.\nImpact\nThis section will proceed to demonstrate that this is a critical bug that meets\n(and exceeds) the requirements stated in the policy.\nIn the description above I've already made the points that:\n1 - The issue reported is fixable.\n2 - The attack has minimal cost when performed by a crowdsourced contract (or\nhigh-balance attacker).\nI'll proceed to show that:\n3 - It's possible to steal 10% (or more) of the value of the collateral in the\nsystem.\nThe attack described consists of repeatedly obtaining DAI interest over large\nbalances in ETH/token that could be used for collateral, but without increasing\nthe overall collateral locked in the system. As the DAI interest is paid for with\nnewly created DAI, this corresponds to a continuous inflation of the DAI supply,\ntransferring value continuously from legitimate holders of DAI.\nUltimately, given enough time, virtually all the DAI market cap could be in the hands of\nthe attackers. The only limiting factor is time, and the rate at which value can\nbe stolen is a function of the value of ETH and collateral tokens available to the\nattackers (which could well be the economic majority in the ETH ecosystem), the\nDSR rate, and the \"Line\" limit.\nAssuming, as an example, that the DSR rate is 2% a year, that the available ETH\nsupply is 20x that of the collateral in the MCD contracts, and that the \"Line\" limit\nis higher than that -- after one year (assuming successful attack in most blocks)\nthe attackers would have inflated the DAI\nsupply in 40%, transfering much more than 10% of collateral value to themselves.\nIt's impossible to know beforehand what values the DSR rate and the \"Line\" limit\nwill have, but all they can do without breaking the contract functionality is\nto slow down the theft. (a DSR rate of 0% would effectively kill the DAI savings\nfunctionality, and low \"Line\" values that prevent DAI from being created in the\nattack would also affect the possibility of new legitimate users joining the system)\nFinal Note\nI understand this is an involved attack, exploiting an issue in the interaction\nbetween several contracts, and with complex economic consequences.\nPlease don't hesitate in contacting me for further explanations or to provide\nany information that can help you reproduce and evaluate the issue.\n\n",

  "vuln_description": "The vulnerability allows attackers to earn free DAI interest by exploiting unsynchronized rate accumulation mechanisms between pot and jug contracts in MCD. By carefully sequencing contract calls, attackers can create and repay CDPs within a single transaction while capturing DSR interest, effectively inflating the DAI supply without holding DAI or taking risk.",
  "reason": "This vulnerability requires deep understanding of multiple interacting MCD contracts (vat, jug, pot, join), their state transitions, and the economic implications of unsynchronized rate updates. The attacker must precisely sequence contract calls while maintaining correct state across all components, and recognize the novel economic attack vector of instant interest capture.",
