Address bar fails to parse character \"\u0578\"(U+0578 Armenian Small Letter). Several other characters from Armenian family lead to the same effect.\nExpected results:\nTORbrowser should have resolved the domain to real http://xn--okia-zgf.com. On chrome, internet explorer and firefox it resolves to xn--okia-zgf.com.\n\n",
