    "content": "\nSummary:\nDashboards in \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 allow a user to add widgets and obtain large amounts of information to include PII and diagnostic information. Additionally, a user is able to make changes to certain catalogs via these widgets.\nDescription:\nImpact\nAn adversary can gain access to PII to include full names, e-mail addresses, physical addresses, phone numbers, etc., as well as modifying fields within the underlying system. Additionally, the adversary could identify information such as the number/type of incidents, as well as diagnostic information such as memory usage.\nStep-by-step Reproduction Instructions\nCreate an account on \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588/ and browse to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 once your account has been verified. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nIf this is your first time accessing this page, you will need to create a dashboard. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nUsing the Add Widgets feature, an adversary can gain access to various information as shown in the picture below. This is just a small glimpse of what an adversary has access to through this panel. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nClicking on the All(22) text in the third widget above, an adversary can access various configuration items. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nThese can then be modified by the adversary as shown below: \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nIf an adversary browses to \u2588\u2588\u2588/home, they get a slightly different interface: \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nBy clicking Add Content in the top left corner, the adversary can add widgets similar to before. This dashboard seems to contain a little more functionality.. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nBy adding \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, the adversary can access PII of many of the users of the website. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nThe \u2588\u2588\u2588 account shown below does not contain much sensitive information, but the fields for the other accounts are highly populated. The \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 account was used instead in effort to prevent showing real user information. \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nSuggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\nRestrict access to these widgets to only those users that need this functionality. Regular users should not have access to this data, especially when the account creation process is so easy.\nImpact\nAn adversary can gain access to PII to include full names, e-mail addresses, physical addresses, phone numbers, etc., as well as modifying fields within the underlying system. Additionally, the adversary could identify information such as the number/type of incidents, as well as diagnostic information such as memory usage.\n\n",
