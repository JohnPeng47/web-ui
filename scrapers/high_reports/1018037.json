    "content": "\nSummary :\nafter trying to change my initial name to something long i found out that their are no limits to how long it can be , so i directly changed it to something very long name.txt (F1050497) which caused my account to really slow down when accessing it and in the android app , it just keeps crashing whenever i open it ( no way to access my account at all ) + if i make it longer i get a 500 Internal Server Error response which highly suggests that this can cause a server side denial of service .\nDescription:\ndue to not checking the length of the name one can change it to a very long one causing both a server side denial of service and a client side one\nserver side :\none can send multiple requests to change the name of the account and each of them containing a very long name which will cause a 500 internal server error leading to an extensive Resource Consumption.\nclient side :\nif one is able to change the name another account he will also have the ability to crash his android app therefore preventing him from accessing his account.\nif one with a long name sends a message to any email he will slowwwwww down everything where the message appears including folders (inbox , trash ..) and prevent him from accessing his contacts where the email's name also appears , because the app will hang on a loading screen for about 40min each time , and this can be more if for example he sends multiple messages or use multiple accounts ( each on with a long name ) to send a message to the victim mail.\nProof of Concept:\nopen https://app.hey.com/contacts/%user_id_number%/user/editand change the name to the one attached name.txt (F1050497) and submit.\nnow u can't open the android app and u can slow down anyone's account just by sending them a message (or multiple ones).\nImpact\nAttacker can perform a DoS Attack against the server\nslow down anyone's account\ncrash the android app\n\n",

This affects both server-side performance (causing 500 Internal Server Errors) and client-side performance (crashing the Android app and slowing down email interfaces).",
