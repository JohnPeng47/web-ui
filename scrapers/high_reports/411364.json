    "vuln_description": "The vulnerability allows brute force attacks on the fabric-ca server admin account due to default configurations like maxenrollments set to -1 (enabling outside enrollment), no restrictions on password attempts, and the server being easily discoverable on 0.0.0.0:7054. This can lead to gaining high-level permissions in a permissioned network.",
