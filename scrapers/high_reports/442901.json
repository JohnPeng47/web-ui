Since the account is created using a social media account, no existing password check is needed and the CSRF check on the endpoint is broken. An attacker can take over accounts created using Google or Facebook by exploiting this vulnerability.",
    "reason": "The vulnerability involves understanding the CSRF flaw in the password reset endpoint for social media-created accounts. While the attack requires knowledge of CSRF exploitation, the steps are straightforward once the vulnerable endpoint is identified. The interaction between social media authentication and the broken CSRF check is somewhat subtle but not highly complex.",
