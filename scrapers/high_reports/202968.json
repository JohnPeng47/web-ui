  "content": "\nReported to the project maintainers in 2016. gre_print_0() and the functions modelled after it passed the value of \"length\" instead of the value of \"caplen\", this could make ether_print() access beyond the memory allocated for the captured packet. Fixed by https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/tcpdump/commit/0db4dcafe5ae38201d3869c96a96cb714d82ff35.\n\n",

  "vuln_description": "In tcpdump before 4.9.0, a bug in multiple protocol parsers could cause a buffer overflow in print-ether.c:ether_print(). The issue arises because gre_print_0() and similar functions incorrectly pass the value of 'length' instead of 'caplen', potentially causing ether_print() to access memory beyond the allocated space for the captured packet.",
  "reason": "The vulnerability involves a straightforward memory handling error in packet parsing, which is a common issue in network utilities. The discovery requires understanding packet capture and parsing but does not involve complex interactions or novel logic.",
