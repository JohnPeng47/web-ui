  "content": "\nHi DoD Team,\nI hope you are doing good today.\nThis is a follow-up from my November 15th 2022 report number #1775217 (https://hackerone.com/reports/1775217)\nIn all respect and to be clear, I don't want to push too hard or be annoying on this and feel free to tell me if you don't want or need to take action on this.\nSince my report #1775217 was left un-answered I felt I should open a new one since I feel this is serious matter.\nRecap of my last report :\nOn November 15th 2022: I opened a report describing how I've found a set of credential publicly exposed from an ITSM system indexed in search engines.\nOn November 16th 2022 :I had a reply telling me that the credentials were valid but didn't have any rights on the system so there was no impact.\nOn November 17th2022 : I had found another set of credentials exposed and I was able to successfully exploit CVE-2018-18862 from this.\nThis was left un-answered.\nOn February 12th 2023: The website was down and I left my report as such.\nSee : https://hackerone.com/reports/1775217 for all the details.\nToday, to my surprise and while doing other searches I stumbled accross this website again.\nI would like to reiterate the following :\nToday, May 16th 2023, the set of Credentials I had found at the time are still working :\nUsername: \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nPassword: \u2588\u2588\u2588\nUsername: \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nPassword: \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nSee screenshot 3, taken on May 16th 2023, the \"\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\" credentials are still exposed.\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nHere is the login page : https://\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588/shared/login.jsp\nToday, May 16th 2023, I can still successfully exploit CVE-2018-18862 - Incorrect access control.\nI decided to re-open the report for the following reasons :\n-I thought about it a long time, since on my prior report I didn't have any reply after the successful CVE exploitation and the new set of credentials found I judged it was worth having a 2nd look.\n-Also, I thought the system was down but today I found out it was not.\nIn all good faith.\nBest regards.\n~pll25\nReferences\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-18862\nImpact\n-An attacker can access the system with the rights of these users.\n-I was able to list Roles.\n-I am potentially able to create/read reports and probably do more but I stopped there because the POC is already proven.\n-2 sets of credentials including valid username and passwords were leaked from this system on November 15th 2022.\nSystem Host(s)\nhttps://\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nAffected Product(s) and Version(s)\nBMC Remedy version unknown\nCVE Numbers\nCVE-2018-18862 - (CVSS V3.0 Score : 8.8 (HIGH), Vector: /AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).\nSteps to Reproduce\nStep 1:\nLet's say we use the account \"\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\".\nLogin with the username and password on this page : https://\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588/shared/login.jsp\n(ScreenShot 1 from November 15th describes how I was able to obtain it).\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\nStep 2 :\nYou should land on an Error web page telling that the file doesn't exist.\nThe landing URL should look like this :\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588/\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588/forms/arpcp/arpc:web:retirementsapplicationsubmission/default+administrator+view/$external%20report%20server%20url_glb$retirementapplication&rs:command=render&preportinstanceid=$536871212$&rs:format=pdf\nStep 3 :\nHere we can exploit CVE-2018-18862 : replace all the text after : /forms/arpc/ (the part of the URL in bold above) with :\n/User/Default+Admin+View1/\nStep 4:\nYou will now have access to the whole Remedy ITSM system.\nFrom there you have successfully exploited CVE-2018-18862.\nI was able to list Roles.\nI am potentially able to create/read reports and probably do more but I stopped there because the POC is already proven.\nSuggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\nChange affected passwords.\nMIgrate the system to a new un-affected version.\nApply the vendor work-arounds if possible.\n\n",
