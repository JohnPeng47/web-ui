When the user wants to upload a file the app allows the user to upload a HTML file leading to stored XSS and creation of a simple php script. A user can upload the HTML file and trigger XSS and trigger potential RCE with php shell. Please go to the \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Request that I created at -- \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588AllOpenOrders/4F4D0C69EA2B33A58525858A001E2B8C?opendocument and select the file at the bottom \"unsure1.html\" to trigger payload to show XSS and php shell.
