    "content": "\nSummary:\nThis vulnerability involves the incorrect display of the download source in the Brave download alert. Instead of displaying the actual source of the downloaded file, the browser displays the referrer header value, which may mislead the user into believing that the file is from a trusted source. This behavior creates a potential security risk as it could allow attackers to trick users into downloading malicious files.\nProducts affected:\nBrave is up to date\nVersion 1.73.97 Chromium: 131.0.6778.108 (Official Build) (arm64)\nSteps To Reproduce:\nVictim visit: https://ybt01.github.io/upload/google.html#\nVictim click click me to download google apk and will pop up download location with wrong files origin\n<image_0>\nPOC\nExpected result\nThe origin source on the download pop up should accurately reflect the actual source of the downloaded file, indicating the URL from which the file was downloaded directly (e.g., https://ybt01.github.io).\nActual Result\nThe origin source on the pop up displays the URL of the referring page (e.g., https://google.com), thus misleading the user about the actual source of the downloaded file.\nSupporting Material/References:\nThis issue is similar to the one in the report: https://issues.chromium.org/issues/352681108\nbut this is a different case because in chrome it is not affected. and in brave it is affected in the download pop up while in the chromium report it is affected in chrome: //downloads. However, in terms of impact and scenario this case is similar.\nImpact\nThis vulnerability can significantly impact user security by providing misleading information about file downloads. Users may unknowingly trust files downloaded from malicious sources, believing they originated from reputable domains. This can facilitate the distribution of malware and other harmful software, especially in targeted attacks by Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups or malicious websites that employ social engineering tactics. As a result, the risk of unintentional malware installation on user systems increases, undermining the overall security posture of users.\n\n",
