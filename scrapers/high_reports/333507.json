  "vuln_description": "A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the 'post last edited' feature of the platform. When an attacker edits or deletes a message in a private conversation, the Victim sees an edit indicator. Clicking this indicator executes the attacker's malicious JavaScript payload, which can lead to cookie theft, password theft, or arbitrary code execution in the Victim's browser.",
  "reason": "The vulnerability involves multiple components (private messaging, edit tracking, and XSS execution) and requires the attacker to understand how the edit indicator triggers the XSS payload. However, the interaction between these components is relatively straightforward once the edit mechanism is understood.",
