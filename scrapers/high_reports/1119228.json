  "vuln_description": "CVE-2021-26855 is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange Server. It allows an attacker to send arbitrary HTTP requests from the Exchange server, potentially leading to unauthorized access to internal services or information disclosure.",
  "reason": "The vulnerability involves crafting specific HTTP headers and cookies to exploit the SSRF flaw. While the attack requires precise header manipulation, the steps are straightforward once the exploit details are known. The complexity is mitigated by the availability of public exploit details and the lack of need for complex application state manipulation or novel logic.",
