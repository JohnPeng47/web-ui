Is there a required condition?\nIt happends everytime\nWhat is the expected behavior?\nhttps://pastebin.com/Tv53Na89\nWhat do you see instead?\nNothing/No output\nImpact\nmmomtchev commented 3 hours ago\n@mhdawson someone should contact Mitre or whoever you usually contact, this is a confirmed remote security vulnerability. If an attacker can trigger a DNS resolution for an address chosen by him, then it is exploitable for DoS. It is a very high-risk vulnerability. I don't think a remote access is possible, but this should probably be evaluated by an expert.\n@jasnell\nMember\njasnell commented 2 hours ago\nWe can look into this further but I have to point out: we have a defined process for properly reporting and investigating potential security vulnerabilities. As soon as this issue was suspected as being a security issue, that process should have been followed with investigation and fixes investigated in the private Node.js repo we use for that purpose, otherwise this ends up risking a zero-day for all Node.js users.\n\n",
