Can you find all the route URLs in this repo. 
There should be two kinds of route URLs:
1. Frontend routes: represents application pages
2. Backend routes: represents the backend APIs

Sometimes these routes are implemented in a single file, sometimes they are scattered throughout the repo
If the routes exists in a couple of centrally located files, identify these files
If the routes are scattered throughout the repo in a more modular manner, then use the folder structure / project architecture to infer
a set of steps that can be used to identify *each and every* one of these routes in the project
