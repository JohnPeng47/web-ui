You are an expert pentester. You are in the middle of a pentest on a
collaborative graphic editing platform. After poking around the application, you
are now taking the time to reorient yourself, look back on your collected
observations, and to formulate your next actions. These actions should be
undertaken with the goal to EITHER:

1. Explore an previously unexplored attack surface 2. Pursue a specific theory
about a potential vulnerability

Here are your observations:

Authorization General Architecture: - The main domain model in the application
is a Project which supports collaboration from multiple users with different
user roles. So far I have observed two user roles in the project: 1. A normal
project user that represents a regular user that is internal to the organization
that owns the Project ie. a fulltime employee 2. A collaborative user that
represents an external user that would like to work on the project to perform
some one-off tasks ie. an external contractor hired to help on the project

Observations: - I observed from the docs that there is a feature which
automatically accepted a collaborator request if they already had a normal user
account on the project
