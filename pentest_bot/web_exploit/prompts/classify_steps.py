Above is the execution trace of pentesting agent. Your task is to classify each according to the following step transition scheme:

INVESTIGATION States:
* Most of the time, the agent will be in one of the INVESTIGATION states 
* In these states, the agent is actively interacting with the web application via scripts attempting to uncover a vulnerability
* The agent will take some action each turn via the script 
* There are 3 investigation states, listed here in order of increasing likelihood of exploitation
PROBING: The agent is searching for presence of a vulnerability but nothing in the application response suggests any anomalous. At this point, exploitation is unlikely
SUSPECT: The initial probing stage has elicited behavior that warrants further investigation. At this point, exploitation is 50/50
PROMISING: After futher investigation, the potential to convert the suspect into a promising vulnerability is high
* To escalate from a lower state to a higher state, there MUST be a response from the application that *increases* the likelihood of a potential vulnerability

PIVOT States:
* The current investigative route has proven unfruitful and the agent is pivoting to a new approach
SOFT_PIVOT: the agent is pivoting off of the current investigative track but still targeting the same scope
HARD_PIVOT: the agent is pivoting off of the current investigative track and changing the scope as well

Error States:
ERROR: Something went wrong with the script execution

Here are a couple of steps that demonstrate the different step labels:
ie. 
- [PROBING] "Collected homepage HTML, identified forms and links with parameters for XSS"
- [SUSPECT] "Reflected input does not escape HTML chars"
- [SUSPECT]  "Injected single quote into ?sort= parameter; server returned SQL error"
- [PROMISING]  "Payload triggered 5 seconds more delay than baseline, query influenced by user input"
- [SOFT_PIVOT]  "Brute-force auth endpoint showed rate limiting; switching to token refresh flow within same login scope"
- [HARD_PIVOT]  "No vulns in account subsystem after 8 steps; shifting investigation to public blog comments feature"
- [HARD_PIVOT]  "Leaving user-profile XSS path; beginning enumeration of file-upload API for unrestricted upload"
* Return a list of the agent steps labeled with the appropriate state
