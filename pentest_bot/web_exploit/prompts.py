*Tips*:
- Always start by **reducing the hypothesis to a single, falsifiable test**.
  Ask: “If this specific parameter is injectable, what automatic effect should
  I observe in the response or the DOM?”

*IMPORTANT* – when you need to print the output from an HTTP request:
1. Always print ``(status_code, len_of_response_body)``.
2. Determine if (1) is enough to accomplish your current tactical objective.
   Make this decision explicit in your reflections.
3. Only print the full response if your outcome from (2) requires it.

If you find the answer according to criteria defined in ``problem_stmt`` then
return the answer; otherwise return *null* for ``answer``.

*Tips*:
XSS:
1. Probe – Send a high-entropy marker (e.g. XSS_9c2b1) in the vulnerable parameter or form field.
2. Locate – After the page re-renders, grep / search the returned HTML, inline scripts, and any fetched resources for the exact marker.
3. Exploit – Based on the context slice you find around the marker (HTML tag, attribute, JS string, template literal, header, etc.), choose the correct break-out payload and iterate until you get code-execution.
4. Rule of thumb – If you can see your marker at all, you can usually exploit the sink without needing to crawl the full DOM first.

XSS:
1. Probe – Send a high-entropy marker (e.g. XSS_9c2b1) in the vulnerable parameter or form field.

### Agent Critique
COMMON_AGENT_MISTAKES = """

AGENT_CRITIQUE_PROMPT = """
The above contains multiple agent trajectories of an agent trying to solve a CTF challenge:

XSS Framework:
1. Probe – Send a high-entropy marker (e.g. XSS_9c2b1) in the vulnerable parameter or form field.
2. Locate – After the page re-renders, grep / search the returned HTML, inline scripts, and any fetched resources for the exact marker.
3. Exploit – Based on the context slice you find around the marker (HTML tag, attribute, JS string, template literal, header, etc.), choose the correct break-out payload and iterate until you get code-execution.
4. Rule of thumb – If you can see your marker at all, you can usually exploit the sink without needing to crawl the full DOM first.

Can you provide a critique of he agent trace according to the framework, noting at which steps it was successful and where it went wrong. While emphasizing the framework above, don't shy away from critiquing other mistakes/successes outside the framework. Include references to the actual trace logs in your explanation.

Types of agent critiques:
Negative Critiques:
1. incorrect inference: one type of critique you might provide is: when evidence or previous actions imply an obvious / correct next step, but the agent fails to make this step
2. looping and on incorrect steps: agent continuously fails by not correctly updating on a previously erroneous step
Positive Critiques:
1. agent realizes that it has been on the wrong track and changes course

Output format:
Provide an individual critique for each agent trajectory in the logs above according to the framework
For each observation, always reference the step number or log line (ie. "[12] 21:45:15")
Also, see if you can identify any common mistakes, that seem to be general biases of the agent wrt to its reasoning process on solving XSS challenges, as opposed to incidental mistakes that are par for the course
