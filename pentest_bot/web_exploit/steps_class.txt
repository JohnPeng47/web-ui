RAW:::
Below is one possible classification of each step in the trace. Note that most steps are “investigative”–the agent is gathering details and trying different static‐analysis techniques (i.e. “probing”) until some potential unsafe code (“suspect”) appears. When previous approaches fail so that the focus or technique must be changed entirely, we mark that as a (hard) pivot. (A “soft” pivot would be if the agent simply adjusts a faulty regex or similar without changing scope; in our trace the fixups are still part of overall probing.)

Here’s one mapping:

1. Step 1 (“First step is reconnaissance …”) – INVESTIGATION / PROBING
2. Step 2 (“The home page didn’t expose any obvious reflection … crawl deeper …”) – INVESTIGATION / PROBING
3. Step 3 (“The crawl only found the root page – likely a SPA …”) – INVESTIGATION / PROBING
4. Step 4 (“Inspect raw HTML/JS … look for hard‐coded routes …”) – INVESTIGATION / PROBING
5. Step 5 (“We still have no hint what parameters the SPA uses; perhaps XSS is in the fragment (#) …”) – INVESTIGATION / PROBING
6. Step 6 (“Goal: identify concrete parameters … rerun JS static–analysis …”) – INVESTIGATION / PROBING
7. Step 7 (“The previous regex pattern failed … rerun with cleaned-up regexes …”) – INVESTIGATION / PROBING
8. Step 8 (“Need to map which JS reads query parameters …”) – INVESTIGATION / PROBING
9. Step 9 (“The previous regex failed because of raw parentheses … adjusting again …”) – INVESTIGATION / PROBING
10. Step 10 (“The last scan showed location.hash is used … mine for literal parameter names …”) – INVESTIGATION / PROBING
11. Step 11 (“We identified that the SPA cares about the fragment – inspect how the hash (eg, view/offers;Id=) is processed …”) – INVESTIGATION / SUSPECT 12. Step 12 (“Need to see if the hash value is ever written straight into the DOM …”) – INVESTIGATION / PROBING
13. Step 13 (“Need to dig deeper in JavaScript to see if the fragment value is concatenated into HTML …”) – INVESTIGATION / PROBING
14. Step 14 (“Dig deeper: re-download fwimobile.min.js and look for flows from location.hash to a sink …”) – INVESTIGATION / PROBING
15. Step 15 (“Still have not proven that a value from window.location.hash is unsafely injected … search full file for co-occurrences …”) – INVESTIGATION / PROBING
16. Step 16 (“Our previous detection of 0 internal <script src> tags suggests the page may be minimal … we re‐fetch the root URL …”) – PIVOT (HARD_PIVOT) 17. Step 17 (“Fetch the homepage again; check status, content-type, body length, and list inline scripts …”) – INVESTIGATION / PROBING
18. Step 18 (“Now that we know the page loads 5 internal JS files, plan to scan them for flows from URL source to DOM sink …”) – INVESTIGATION / PROBING
19. Step 19 (“Previous script crashed because of misuse of raise_for_status … adjust to use response.text() …”) – INVESTIGATION / PROBING
20. Step 20 (“Fix: the last attempt failed because response.status was mistakenly called …”) – INVESTIGATION / PROBING
21. Step 21 (“We now know the five internal JS files; plan a concise static scan for co-occurrences …”) – INVESTIGATION / PROBING
22. Step 22 (“Need a closer look at fwimobile.min.js – show ±1500‑char windows with both a SOURCE and a SINK …”) – INVESTIGATION / PROBING
23. Step 23 (“The previous scan showed some co-occurrences but nothing clearly concatenates a user–supplied value; we should re–orient to live reflection testing …”) – PIVOT (HARD_PIVOT)
24. Step 24 (“Redo the basic reconnaissance using correct calls (using resp.status as an attribute) …”) – INVESTIGATION / PROBING

Thus, almost all steps fall within the “investigation” scope, with most actions being probing; only a couple represent a pivot (steps 16 and 23, which redirect the attack strategy) and one step (step 11) shows a suspect behavior worth further investigation.
1. Step 1 – The agent begins by fetching the homepage and enumerating links and forms. No anomalies are found yet, so this is an initial probing phase.
  State: PROBING

2. Step 2 – The agent crawls deeper to look for reflected parameters, but still no obvious reflection is found.
  State: PROBING

3. Step 3 – The agent inspects the raw HTML/JS for hard-coded routes and query‑parameter hints. No useful sink is found.
  State: PROBING

4. Step 4 – The agent turns to statically analyze the JavaScript files for common URL–reading patterns.
  State: PROBING

5. Step 5 – The investigation shifts focus to checking the fragment (window.location.hash) usage, since no query parameters are obvious.
  State: PROBING

6. Step 6 – The agent aims to identify concrete parameters by scanning all internal JS files for URL–access patterns.
  State: PROBING

7. Step 7 – After encountering regex errors, the agent corrects the patterns and reruns the analysis.
  State: PROBING

8. Step 8 – The agent narrows the static scan by looking for lines that combine a dangerous sink with a URL–source.
  State: PROBING

9. Step 9 – With cleaned regexes the agent reruns the JS analysis to capture combined SOURCE–SINK snippets.
  State: PROBING

10. Step 10 – The agent mines the JS assets for literal parameter strings (e.g. “Id”, “OfferId”) but still lacks clear confirmation.
  State: PROBING

11. Step 11 – The agent identifies that the application pays attention to URL fragments (e.g. “#view/offers;Id=”); this observation raises enough suspicion to warrant deeper investigation.
  State: SUSPECT

12. Step 12 – The agent looks into the specific JS (fwimobile.min.js) to see if the fragment value is passed into DOM sinks.
  State: SUSPECT

13. Step 13 – A targeted search is performed for instances where the hash value is “close” to a DOM-writing function.
  State: SUSPECT

14. Step 14 – The investigation digs deeper into fwimobile.min.js to capture a larger context that might reveal unsanitized concatenation.
  State: SUSPECT

15. Step 15 – Even after scanning wider windows for co-occurrences, the agent still has not proven an unsafe DOM injection – the possibility remains suspect but unconfirmed.
  State: SUSPECT

16. Step 16 – Noticing that no internal external JS files were detected on the previous track, the agent decides to pivot the investigative approach by re‐examining the raw homepage response. This represents a shift in tactics and scope.
  State: HARD_PIVOT

17. Step 17 – The agent re-fetches the homepage, checking response code, content-type, length, and prints the first 1200 characters. This basic reconnaissance confirms that a full page is returned and internal inline scripts are present.
  State: PROBING

18. Step 18 – The agent now outlines a plan to download all internal JS files and scan for dangerous sinks near URL–sources.
  State: PROBING

19. Step 19 – After a crash due to API method misuse, the agent adjusts the code to use the proper Playwright response methods and reattempts basic reconnaissance.
  State: PROBING

20. Step 20 – The agent redoes the basic reconnaissance correctly (fixing the response.status call) and verifies the internal <script> sources.
  State: PROBING

21. Step 21 – With recognition of five internal JS files, the agent now plans a static scan to spot flows where URL data might be written into the DOM.
  State: PROBING

22. Step 22 – Focusing on fwimobile.min.js, the agent extracts long context windows where both a URL–source and DOM–sink appear. Some suspicious flows are observed, suggesting that fragment values (like after “#view/offers;Id=”) may be used unsafely.
  State: SUSPECT

23. Step 23 – Realizing that the static scan has not conclusively shown unsanitized injection, the agent decides to change approach by investigating live page reflection (e.g. sending payloads via query string or fragment).
  State: PROBING

24. Step 24 – The agent redoes the basic GET request (correcting previous mistakes with response.status) one final time to verify headers and body output before concluding that no exploit has been confirmed.
  State: PROBING
