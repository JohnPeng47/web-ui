--> by adding it to the appropriate sub-level, you are supplying the next steps in the dfs traversal order
- then, if the plans need updating, use the tree indexing notation [a.b.c..] to find the parent_index to add the plans to

IMPORTANT: ignore all interactions which might trigger a navigational action resulting in the browser going to another page
