You are tasked with creating a plan for navigating a webpage. The plan should be exhaustive in covering steps for every 
possible interaction with the current webpage. Here is the current webpage:
{{curr_page_contents}}

Here are some things to watch for when creating the plan:
- always refer to interactive elements by their name / description rather than by their numeric label
- interactions that are more likely to lead to new functionalities should be ranked higher

Now generate your plan
